            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>BEARN,</hi> though one of the leaſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces ſubject to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> may be accounted among the moſt conſiderable, for the great number of Soldiers it ſends into the Armies. It hath the honour of giving Birth to the Renowned Prince, <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, and the Privileges he granted it are ſufficient proof of the eſteem he had for the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. And thoſe who now ſerve the King in his Wars, have made it appear they have not degenerated from the vertues of their Anceſtors. Beſides, as if it were not enough for this Province to produce Heroes in an Age, when all parts of <hi>France</hi> furniſh ſuch plenty of them, it hath ſignaliz'd it ſelf in giving Birth to a Heroine, who ſeems to have
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:135663:6"/> forgot the infirmities of her Sex, to aſſume the vigour and generoſity of the Maſculine, without loſing the beauty and ſweetneſs of her own, and to compoſe of both, the moſt perfect Perſon in the Univerſe.</p>
                  <p>Her Name is <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> Daughter to the Baron of <hi>Meyrac,</hi> one of the moſt eminent of the Province, though leſs known at Court than in his Country, where he ſpent all his days. He had an only Son brought up at the College of <hi>Pau,</hi> whom he deſign'd to ſend timely to <hi>Paris</hi> to learn his exerciſes, the better to fit him for the King's ſervice, in the Armies where he intended to provide him employment. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> was bred at home with her Parents as their darling: ſhe naturally had that ſtrong inclination for Arms, ſhe knew ſooner how to diſcharge a Gun, than to handle a Diſtaff; and at nine years old could handle and uſe all ſorts of Fire-arms with incredible dexterity. She was extreamly averſe from Learning to read, and to perſwade her now and then to look on a Book, they were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to permit her to go a-hunting twice a week; but to purchaſe a pound of Pouder ſhe would do any thing, how difficult ſoever. This for a time was a divertiſement to her Parents; till
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> having one day ſhot at Pidgeons in a Barn full of Corn, it unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately took fire, which conſum'd a great part of it, though a great many hands were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently at work to quench it. At this the Baron was ſo offended with his Daughter, that he would not ſee her for many days, nor
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:135663:6"/> pardon her, but upon condition ſhe would never handle a Gun. Poor
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> was very glad to be re-admitted upon any terms into the favour of a Father, ſo ſevere as ſhe knew hers to be: but that way of living being quite againſt her temper, a week was ſcarce paſt, but there appear'd a viſible alteration in her looks. This alarm'd her Mother, who tenderly lov'd her, and having often, but in vain, endeavour'd to prevail with her Husband in favour of his Daughter, to remit a little of the rigour of his orders; ſhe order'd a Gun to be carried to a Neighbour's, where <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> by agreement with her Mother, ſometimes reſorted: And not daring to go a-Hunting, leaſt the Father ſhould know it, ſhe ſhot at a mark for her exerciſe. This reſtrant but heightened her paſſion for Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Shooting, as ſhe made ſufficiently appear by the advantages ſhe took of her Father's abſence, in a Journey about that time.</p>
                  <p>The Baron in the Vacations ſent for his Son home; and Hunting being the principal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation of Country-Gentlemen, ſcarce a day paſt, but his Son made a match with his Friends for that ſport: He never went forth, but <hi>Chriſtina</hi> was cruelly vext, ſhe could not make one of the Game; and when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, ſhe was not leſs troubled for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſhe fanſied he had enjoy'd, and ſhe was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly debarr'd from, and ſeeing her Brother come every day home laden with Game that he had taken, ſhe could not forbear tormenting
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:135663:7"/> herſelf for fear he would leave none for her.</p>
                  <p>One day, as the Baron and his Son were a-Hunting, a Farmer came to the Caſtle to make his complaint of the great ſpoil done in his Corn by a wild Boar, and to beg aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance for killing him. The Baroneſs being aſſur'd the Boar never fail'd coming to the Corn in the Twilight, promis'd to take order in it, and diſmiſs'd the Countryman. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> having over-heard the diſcourſe, ſaid not a word to her Mother, leaſt ſhe might endeavour to divert her from her deſign; but charg'd her Gun with two bullets, and as it began to be dark, went away to the place the Country-Man had ſpoken of; and to make the ſurer work, got up into a Tree a little diſtant from the Corn, with a reſolution to wait there the coming of the Boar. The ſame Country-man having met the Baron's Son as he return'd from Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, told him the ſtory, who loth to loſe ſo fair an occaſion, inſtantly turn'd back into the Field, and fearing he was come too late, ſtole gently a-croſs the Corn, and attended the Boar's coming near half an hour: But growing impatient of longer ſtay, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to retire. His Siſter in the Tree, not well able to diſcern what ſhe imagin'd ſhe ſaw, the Corn being high and night come on, made no doubt but it was the boar ſtirring up and down; and to loſe no time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd her Gun, and kill'd her Brother. As he fell he cry'd out for help, which ſo troubled
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:135663:7"/> the unfortunate <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> that ſhe preſently fell down from the top of the Tree. The Country-man runing in at the noiſe of the Gun, immediately met
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> tearing her ſelf like a Woman diſtracted, and thought the Boar had wounded her: He ask'd her ſeveral que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, which ſhe anſwer'd not, but he took her up, and help'd her to walk a few ſteps. When ſhe found her ſelf in a condition to go alone, ſhe order'd him to make all the haſt in his power to let the Baron know his Son lay a-dying, having been danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wounded by the Boar; with that ſhe made away as faſt as ſhe could poſſibly, not knowing whither to betake her ſelf. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing travell'd above an hour ſhe found her ſelf near a Caſtle belonging to the Abbot <hi>Dizeſte,</hi> who was extreamly ſurprized to ſee her ſo bloated with crying, and at that time of the night. But <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> having given him as good an account of her misfortune as ſhe could in the caſe ſhe was in, the Abbot who was her fathers very near Kinſman, inſtantly got on Horſe-back, and arriv'd at the Caſtle, the very moment they brought in the Body of the poor Gentleman, who having loſt much blood for want of help, dy'd in the Arms of the Chirurgeon who firſt dreſt him. All things in the Caſtle were in ſuch a confuſion, the Abbot could not learn tne truth of the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. The people would needs believe the Boar had kill'd the Gentleman, though they found two bullets in his body: But the Baron and his Lady, not finding <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> made no
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:135663:8"/> doubt but it was her act; and though they believ'd ſhe had don't by misfortune, the Baron was ſo tranſported with paſſion, for the loſs of his Son, that he made ſearch for his Daughter all over the Town, with his Piſtol in his hand, to ſacrifice her to his Wrath. The Abbot being told of it, ran after him, and having ſaid to him all that might be expected on ſuch an occaſion, he brought him back to the Caſtle, where he made uſe of many tedious diſcourſes to comfort him, but all to no purpoſe. Two Capuchins came in at the noiſe of the diſaſter; and the Abbot having left them the care of comforting of the Baron, return'd home to bring <hi>Chriſtina</hi> the news of her Brothers Death, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhe was in, if her Father ſhould diſcover where ſhe was; yet he aſſured her of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and that he would never forſake her.</p>
                  <p>Returning two days after to <hi>Meyrac,</hi> he was not a little ſurpriz'd to find the Capuchins exhortations had not abated in the leaſt the grief of the Baron, nor diminiſh'd his anger, but that he perſiſted in his reſolution to be the death of his Daughter, and would not admit of his Wife into his preſence, becauſe ſhe had been prevailed upon to ſpeak to him a word or two, in favour of the unfortunate <hi>Chriſtina.</hi> This oblig'd the Abbot to hold a conference with two or three Kinſmen more of the Barons, and to debate the buſineſs with them, and find out ſome means to ſave her from her Father's reſentment. After
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:135663:8"/> long diſcourſe, it was agreed ſhe ſhould be ſent into <hi>Spain;</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi> being not above nine or ten Leagues from <hi>Bearn,</hi> and the Abbot having a Brother ſettled at <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſa</hi> many years, he was intreated to bear her company thither, and recommend her to his Brother, which he readly promis'd. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina,</hi> troubled as ſhe was, receiv'd with joy the reſult of this conference, and put her ſelf in a poſture to be gone on the morrow, according to order: but the Abbot having reflected in the night on the conſequences of the intended Journey, found in it ſo many difficulties, that he had almoſt alter'd his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution by morning. He foreſaw the beauty of <hi>Chriſtina</hi> would make a great noiſe in a ſtrange Country, being at twelve years old far taller and handſomer than Maids of that Age ordinarily are, and eſpecially in <hi>Spain,</hi> were the Women are generally very low: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he apprehended the frank humour of his Kinſ-woman, and the inclinations ſhe had ſo different from the reſt of her Sex, would hardly ever agree with the Genius of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where Women are oblig'd to live with a great deal of circumſpection, and that it might prove very troubleſom to his Brother. But the buſineſs was urgent, and he muſt reſolve: <hi>Chriſtina</hi> perceiving him waver, ask'd him the reaſon; he acquainted her with the difficulties he apprehended, and added, It was not decent or fit a young Maid ſhould run rambling into a ſtrange Country. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> longing to get out of her Father's reach,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:135663:9"/> whom ſhe fear'd, and having a paſſionate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee
<hi>Spain,</hi> propos'd to the Abbot, that if he would give her leave, ſhe would put on Boys Cloaths: And that ſhe might have a plauſible pretence for ſtaying in <hi>Spain,</hi> he need no more but tell his Brother he brought him a young Kinſ-man to learn <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and ſtudy ſome Months in the Univerſity of <hi>Saragoſa.</hi> The Abbot at firſt boggled at the propoſal as ridiculous and childiſh. But finding her perſiſt in it, and promiſing ſhe would ſo diſguiſe her ſelf they ſhould never diſcover her Sex, he was perſwaded by her. And having cauſed her to be privately put into a habit ſutable to her inclinations, he thought ſhe became it ſo well, that he made no more ſcruples, but parted the next day with her for <hi>Saragoſa.</hi> Being arrived there, they were receiv'd by his Brother with incredible joy and abundance of thanks, that he would truſt him with the Education of a Kinſ-man of ſo promiſing a meen. The Abbot returned, and Don <hi>Lorenzo</hi> his Brother, took pleaſure in making proviſion of neceſſaries for his young Kinſ-man. Scholars in <hi>Spain</hi> wear long, looſe, black Veſts like the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> a Habit that ſerved very well to make
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> look taller and handſomer, and her Hair being of a delicate-brown, and cut after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>-mode, had an admirable effect upon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders. She no ſooner appear'd in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, but ſhe drew after her the Eyes and the Hearts of the Students. It is incredible what an advantage this was to the <hi>French</hi> Nation;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:135663:9"/> for <hi>Spain</hi> being a Country inconvenient for Travellers, few Perſons of Quality go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And they ſeldom have amongſt them any <hi>French,</hi> unleſs it be ſome poor Labourers of the Mountains of <hi>Auvergne, Limoſin,</hi> and <hi>Bigorre,</hi> who for very ſmall wagers do all manner of Drudgery. And the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally lazy, are willing to imploy <hi>French</hi>-men who ſerve them for money. This is the reaſon the People of thoſe Countries, who ſeldom travel abroad, ſlight the <hi>French,</hi> as they do, judging of the whole Nation by thoſe they ſee amongſt them. This general prejudice heightened their aſtoniſhment, who admir'd the beauty of <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> and call'd her
<hi>The Handſom Frenchman.</hi> Everyone one ſtrove to be acquainted with the Stranger; and her Reputation was in a short time ſo well ſettled at <hi>Saragoſa,</hi> that thoſe of the beſt Quality there order'd their Children, to get acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the young
<hi>Frenchman,</hi> and to make him their Friend.</p>
                  <p>The Marqueſs <hi>d'Oſſeyra</hi> then a Student there, went every morning to take him with him in his Coach to the Univerſity, and Don <hi>Philip de Palafox,</hi> Son to the Marqueſs
<hi>d' Arizza,</hi> brought him back for the moſt part in his. He viſited theſe two young Lords oftner than any other, eſpecially the Marqueſs <hi>d' Oſſeyra,</hi> who took pleaſure to teach him <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and tell him when he ſpoke amiſs. This Gentleman had a Siſter married to the Marqueſs <hi>d' Aytona;</hi> who having heard an excellent Report of the handſome <hi>Frenchman,</hi> deſired her Brother to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:135663:10"/> bring him with him to her Houſe, propoſing to her ſelf the pleaſure to be expected from the Converſation of two young Lads of their Age. But ſhe found it more charming, and was ſo ſatisfied with the firſt Viſit, that ſhe pray'd her Brother to bring him often to her; being extreamly delighted to ſee him and hear him ſpeak. To engage him to come again, ſhe preſented him with a Sword, and her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with another; which they carried com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly under their Gowns, as the Scholars in <hi>Spain</hi> uſually do. This Preſent was fatal to them both: For as they were going home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one Evening very late, they met other Scholars who knew the <hi>Handſome French-man,</hi> and could not forbear (out of a Natural antipathy againſt the <hi>French</hi>) to give him ill-language and call him
<hi>French-bougre.</hi> The Marqueſs <hi>d'Oſſeyra,</hi> thinking himſelf concern'd in their ill-uſage and incivility, and not daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the number of his Enemies, charged them vigorouſly with his Sword in his hand. The <hi>Handſome-Frenchman</hi> ſeconded him ſo well, that they two beat back five Men above thirty paces: till putting on two far, they were at laſt forc'd to give Ground, oppreſt with numbers of freſh aſſailants. The Marqueſs had a ſlight wound on the Face; and the <hi>Handſome-Frenchman</hi> receiv'd a cut upon the Belly. Some Tradeſmen get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of their Shops, the Marqueſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered himſelf, and the Scholars took their a heels to avoid the punishment their inſolence deſerv'd. The wounded Perſons were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:135663:10"/> home to the Marchioneſs <hi>d'Oſſeyra</hi>'s, who was ſo troubled at the news of her Sons being wounded, that she ſwooned away twice: but the Chirurgeon having convinc'd her it was only a Scratch, she turn'd all her care towards the Pretty <hi>Frenchman,</hi> who would not be ſearch'd though they preceiv'd him loſe much blood: but he was obſtinate, and all they could ſay could not prevail with him to let the Chirurgeon ſee his wound. The part he was wounded in troubl'd him more than the wound, as fore-ſeeing it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to keep the ſecret of his Sex undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd among ſuch a Croud as waited there to ſee the firſt dreſſing. Being preſs'd, and ſeeing them ready to force him to give way for the Chirurgeon to ſearch the wound, he deſired to ſpeak a word with the Marchioneſs in private; and told her, that for very ſubſtantial rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons she should one day be acquainted with, she had been oblig'd to diſguiſe her Sex; and begg'd of her by all that's Good, not to diſcover her, and to charge the Chirurgeon not to do it. The Marchioneſs ſurpriz'd at the news, promis'd what she deſir'd: and having commanded all the reſt to quit the Room but the Chirurgeon, she remain'd alone with him and <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> whoſe wound appear'd not dangerous: and the Chirurgeon undertook it should be cured in five or ſix days. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs not able to comprehend why his Friend was ſo ſcrupulous, earneſtly begg'd his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to tell him what he had ſaid to her in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and why she made all the Company
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:135663:11"/> quit the Room: She gave him an anſwer that ſatiſfied him.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, Don <hi>Lorenzo</hi> coming in haſtily, upon the news of his Kinſ-man being wounded, would have carried him home; but the Marchioneſs refuſing her conſent, told him, His Kinſ-man had been wounded in the defence of her Son, and ſhould not go out of her Houſe uncur'd. On the morrow Don <hi>Lorenzo</hi> renew'd his Requeſt to have his Kinſ-man home, whom he lov'd as tenderly as if he were his Son. The Marchioneſs ſtuck to her firſt Reſolution; and the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon who had the <hi>Frenchman</hi> in cure coming in, Don
<hi>Lorenzo</hi> would have the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to ſee the condition of the Wound: but the Marchioneſs obſtinately refuſing him a ſight of it, without giving him any tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reaſon, Don <hi>Lorenzo</hi> fanſy'd his Kinſ-man mortally wounded, and that to be the cauſe of her obſtinate refuſals. This made him ſend for two very able Chirurgeons, in whom he thought he might place an intire confidence. And when they were come he pray'd them to ſee the Wound, and give him their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> more troubled with the unſeaſonable kindneſs of her Kinſ-man than the pains of her Wounds, was forc'd to impart the ſecret to him, as well as to the Marchioneſs, that ſhe might be at eaſe from his importunate Care of her. Don <hi>Lorenzo</hi> could hardly believe her, and thought they but jeſted with him, till the Marchioneſs ſeriouſly affirmed it. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> was perfectly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:135663:11"/> cur'd in a ſhort time, and ſooner perhaps than ſhe could have wiſh'd, imagining a Secret known to ſo many, could not long be kept private. She was loath to expoſe her ſelf to the diſcretion of ſo many; and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd to Don <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s, notwithſtanding the reſiſtance made by the Marchioneſs, ſhe was dreſs'd in Maids Apparel, and ſo continu'd thenceforwards; being ſo aſham'd of what had happen'd to her, that ſhe would not ſtir out of her Chamber.</p>
                  <p>The Young Marqueſs <hi>d'Oſſeyra</hi> hearing the news went to Don <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s to ſee his old Comerade, more out of curioſity than on any other account. The Marchioneſs
<hi>d'Aytona</hi> long'd extreamly to ſee <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> and take her home to her: But
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to receive any Viſit. And to be rid of their importunity, prayed her Kinſ-man to put her into a Nunnery for ſome time, and to give it out ſhe was returned into <hi>France</hi> Don <hi>Lorenzo</hi> approved the deſign, and made a Viſit to the Lady Abbeſs of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſulines,</hi> to intreat her to receive a Kinſ-woman of his into the number of her Penſioners. All things beieg agreed on,
<hi>Chriſtinae</hi> was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately put into the Convent of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſulines,</hi> where ſhe was kindly entertain'd, her beauty gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her the affection of all that ſaw her. And when ſhe had been there long enough to give them a taſt of her Wit and good Humour, the good Nuns were ſingularly well-pleaſed with her Company; and ſhe gain'd ſo great a Reputation among the Penſioners, that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:135663:12"/> they did nothing without her advice. She ſpent about ſix Months in this Place of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge and Security, from the great power of Fortune; who vext to ſee her ſo much at eaſe, cut her out more work, and raiſed her new troubles, which forc'd her out of her port to be toſt with freſh turmoils.</p>
                  <p>The Prelates of <hi>Spain</hi> are very exact in viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Religious-Houſes, as well for encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Nuns who have great venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for them, as to diſcharge the duty of their Paſtoral-Office. The Arch-biſhop of <hi>Saragoſa</hi> going to viſit the Convent of
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſulines,</hi> the Nuns having receiv'd his Benediction, treated him with a pretty merry Comedy, wherein <hi>Chriſtina</hi> acted the part of Don <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho Abarca</hi> King of
<hi>Arragon,</hi> and did it admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably well. The Arch-biſhop who had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times ſeen
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> a Student, looking on her in Man's Habit on this occaſion, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently knew her; and the more eaſily, for that <hi>Chriſtina</hi> being extreamly handſome and of more than ordinary ſtature, there was ſcarce ſuch another to be ſeen in <hi>Spain.</hi> The Comedy being ended, the good Nuns who expected great applauſe for performing ſo well, were aſtoniſht to ſee the Prelate's Face glow with indignation and anger: He called the Superior aſide with two of the graveſt Nuns; and told them, he was very much ſcandaliz'd to ſee that in contempt of the Rules of their Order, and to the great ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of ſo many Devout Souls in the Convent, they had the boldneſs to introduce into it a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:135663:12"/> Young Man to act his part in the Comedy. The Nuns look'd on one another without ſaying a word: The Superiour more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd than the reſt, ſpoke for her ſelf, and aſſured the Arch-biſhop there was not a Man among the afters; and that every part of the Comedy was acted by ſuch only as ſhe very well knew, and had long been of the Houſe. The Arch-biſhop thinking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as fully aſſur'd of the contrary, asked her who acted Don
<hi>Sancho,</hi> and how ſong that Perſon had been of the Houſe: The Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our anſwer'd, it was a <hi>French</hi> Maid, a Kinſ-woman of Don <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s, who recommended her very earneſtly to them, and one who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved her ſelf very well. How credulous are you, poor Innocents, ſays the Arch-biſhop, you have taken in a Wolf, and lock'd him up among the Sheep. The good Souls were preſently nonpluſt; and without farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, pray'd the Prelate the Criminal might be inſtantly arreſted, and brought to Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Puniſhment. The Arch-biſhop being a Perſon of more than ordinary diſcretion, was not of their mind, but repreſented to them the inconveniences might attend the publiſhing this buſineſs, which would be matter of laughter and ſport to the World, and a diſhonour to the Convent; adding, that without doubt the Young Man had been blindly led away with a violent Paſſion he had for ſome one of the Penſioners; that they ſhould watch and endeavour to ſurprize them, and then have them Married. The Nuns
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:135663:13"/> received with a great deal of reſpect the Arch-biſhops Counſel; and having given him thanks, promis'd to follow his Advice. He was no ſooner gone, but the Superiour called for the Siſter who had the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Penſioners, and having made particular and exact inquiry into <hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s Life, and which of the Penſioners ſhe was moſt intimate with, ſhe found ſhe lived in very ſtrict Correſpondence and Amity with
<hi>Zera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine Cortes,</hi> one of the handſomeſt Siſters in the Convent, and a conſiderable Fortune: That ſame, without doubt, is the Wretch hath yielded up her Honour, and profaned our Convent, ſays the Superiour; and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſecreſie the Arch-biſhop had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to her, immediatley ſhe call'd a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, and with tears in her Eyes declar'd to the Siſters the misfortune befallen their Convent, and deſir'd their advice in that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Affair. Many, eſpecially the Elder Nuns, inſenſible of the pleaſures of Youth, were for delivering the Criminals into the hands of the Secular Juſtice. But it was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by Majority of Voices, and reſolved that <hi>Chriſtina</hi> and her ſuppos'd Miſtreſs ſhould be lock'd up a part in ſeveral Cells, and fed only with Bread and Water, till the Arch-biſhop ſhould prevail with Don <hi>Franciſco Cortes</hi> for his Pardon, and conſent for Marriage. The Criminals were accordingly call'd to the Bar, where they received as ſevere Reprimands as anger could ſuggeſt. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> who at firſt thought all done in Railery, could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:135663:13"/> laughing; but finding them in good earneſt ſhe ſtood upon her Juſtification, but to no purpoſe; for without giving her leave to ſpeak they ſhut her up, and executed the Order of the Convocation with that rigour, they gave only pitiful old Pallets to lie on. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> ſent the Superiour word by her Keeper, that to know her miſtake, ſhe need only have her ſearch'd; and that ſhe would moſt willingly undergo any puniſhment if ſhe were not as other Women. This was reported to the Superiour; but the Nuns were all ſo prepoſſeſt, that there was not one in the Convent would undertake ſearching her, for fear of meeting ſome Bug-bears the Nuns are terribly afraid of. Don <hi>Franciſco Cortes</hi> being privately told of the buſines, was for having them puniſh'd as Vitiated Veſtals, and buried alive. The Arch-biſhop who was for moderate courſes, ſent for Don <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo;</hi> and having aggravated the Enormity of the Crime he had commited in introducing his Kinſ-man among the Nuns in Womens Apparel, without giving him time to anſwer, he asked him of what Quality and Fortune that Wretch was. Don <hi>Lorenzo</hi> aſtoniſht at this long Diſcourſe, gave him an account of <hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s Adventures, and made him clearly ſenſible of the Error he had committed in the Judgment he made of thoſe two Young Perſons; and added, the Marchioneſs
<hi>d'Oſſeyra</hi> would confirm all he told him. The Arch-biſhop was ſatisfied, and went directly to the Convent to diſabuſe the poor Nuns, by acquainting them with all that had happen'd
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:135663:14"/> to <hi>Chriſtina</hi> ever ſince ſhe came into <hi>Spain.</hi> The Priſoners were ſet at Liberty, and having thank'd the Arch-biſhop, were the firſt that laugh'd and diverted themſelves with their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſter. The Marchioneſs
<hi>d'Oſſeyra</hi> underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Chriſtina</hi> was in the Convent, and not gone into
<hi>France,</hi> as had been reported, went to ſee her, with the Marchioneſs <hi>D' Aytona</hi> her Daughter, who was raviſh'd with her company. The young Marqueſs who was in the Country, having heard the News by Letter from his Siſter, came away Poſt to ſee <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> who appear'd ſo Charming in her Natural Habit, that from that very moment the Friendſhip he had for her improv'd it ſelf into Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and Love: <hi>Chriſtina</hi> perceiving it by his diſcourſe, and the diſorder he appear'd in, would have withdrawn, telling him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he would alter his Language, he ſhould never ſee her more. The Marqueſs to keep her a little longer with him, promis'd all ſhe deſir'd, and pray'd her to admit him to viſit her at leaſt thrice a week, but ſhe gave him leave to ſee her only once a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night.</p>
                  <p>The Nuns, the mean while, ſtrove who ſhould firſt make her Peace with <hi>Chriſtina</hi> and her Comrade, telling them how ſorry they were for their ill uſage; and upon this occaſion every one would needs perſwade them ſhe had voted in their favour, or at leaſt had ſtill a good opinion of them. But all agreed, that the Siſter who was over the Quire had been the moſt bitter againſt them; and when ſhe ſaw ſhe could not prevail to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:135663:14"/> have them made away, ſhe inſiſted ſtrongly, they ſhould be made a publick example. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> had particular confidence in that Nun, and took her for her beſt Friend; for that the <hi>Choire</hi> and the Veſtry being under her Charge, ſhe often pray'd <hi>Chriſtina</hi> (who was very handy) to help her to wind up Ribband, and other little offices, which ſhe did for her with ſingular dexterity and neatneſs. This Nun was prodigiouſly covetous, and not liking the Wax-lights a Chandler provided for the Convent, she would needs try the making ſome with the help of another Nun of her humour; but her Huſwifery prov'd ſo bad, and the Candles burnt ſo dim, they could ſcarce ſee by that light in the
<hi>Choire,</hi> which was excellent ſport for the other Nuns, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the Penſioners, who hated her mortally: they reſolv'd to play her a Trick; <hi>Chriſtina</hi> having got ſome Powder, with the help of her dear Friend <hi>Zeraphine Cortes,</hi> ſow'd two Cords together, and having roll'd them up hollow, ſhe cover'd them with Wax, and fill'd them with Powder ſo neatly, that no body would have thought but they were Wax-Candles: they had the dexterity to put to them little Matches, which should burn about half a quarter of an hour before the fire came at the Powder. At night when prayer time in the <hi>Choire</hi> was come, they took away the Lights that were in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks, and put in theirs in their ſtead: as ſoon as they were lighted, they preſently obſerv'd they burnt dimmer than ordinary; but this was no news: yet the good Siſter
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:135663:15"/> (who thought they were her handy-work) impatient to ſee them caſt ſo dull a light, would needs mend one of them, and take off a little Wax that was melted about it. By this time the Powder took fire and went off like a Gun: the poor Nun fell flat on her back, and the reſt were ſo amaz'd, they were ready to run away. One of the boldeſt of them runing in to help the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Surintendant of the <hi>Choire,</hi> the other Candle fir'd with more noiſe than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: this put the poor Nuns into a perfect Confuſion; the fearful runaway, the reſt ſtaid to help their Companions, only <hi>Chriſtina</hi> and her Friend were pleaſed with the diſorder, and laught as if they would burſt. The Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row they held many Arguments about the accident; moſt were of opinion the Devil had a hand in it, and that the Lights were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd: The Nun, Surintendant of the <hi>Choire,</hi> would no longer meddle with them, and the Superiour was forced to make uſe of her old Chandler again.</p>
                  <p>The Marchioneſs <hi>d' Aytona</hi> being alone, by reaſon of her Husbands abſence at
<hi>Madrid,</hi> to attend his imployments there, had long (but in vain) wish'd to have
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> at her Houſe; and being oblig'd on the Morrow for the Country, ſhe begg'd her company ſo earneſtly, it was not in her power to refuſe her. The Spaniſh Ladies have commonly as little divertiſement in the Country as in Town, being generally shut up in their Chambers, and receive no Viſits but from their near Kindred. The Marqueſs <hi>d' Oſſeyra</hi> made ſo
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:135663:15"/> good uſe of his privilege of Brother, that he went every day to ſee his Siſter, though not ſo much to complement her, as to have a ſight of <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> with whom he was Charm'd. In one of his Viſits he had the opportunity to declare his paſſion for her, and let her know the violence of it in the tendereſt expreſſions, aſſuring her it ſhould laſt while he lived. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> interrupting him, intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to quit his Paſſion, and think no more of Love; ſince in the condition ſhe was in, there was reaſon to believe he intended to make her his Miſtreſs, and could not have any thoughts of Marrying a Stranger, being ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unaquainted with her Quality and Fortune. But the Amorous Marqueſs having ſworn ſeveral times he would Marry her when ſhe pleas'd, though
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> was of all perſons the leaſt inclin'd to Love, to ſatisfie him, ſhe told him, if he would continue in the ſame mind two years, that ſhe might be convinc'd he had no ill deſign, she would allow him the liberty to hope: that in the mean time she expected it as an Evidence of his Love, to ſay no more of it, but reſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with her Promiſe. The Marqueſs had that reſpect for her, that he forthwith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd for fear of diſpleaſing her, and reſolv'd to keep ſilent the Paſſion he had for her two years, in hopes by ſo ſignal obedience to win upon, and maſter the inſenſibility of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs. The Marchioneſs had ſent for a Fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler who had the Reputation of the beſt Marks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in <hi>Spain.</hi> One day in complaiſance to <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> she went out in her Coach to ſee
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:135663:16"/> the skill of the Fowler, who made five shots at Partridges flying, and kill'd but two: however he was admir'd, ſo few there are in <hi>Spain</hi> that shoot flying.
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> ſlighting the pretended skill of the Fowler, lighted out of the Coach, and taking the Marquiſs <hi>d'Oſſey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>'s Gun, made ready to shoot the firſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge that ſprung: By good fortune they put up a Covey, <hi>Chriſtina</hi> shot and kill'd three of them; and unconcern'd at the Applauſe of the Spectators, new-charg'd her Gun, and having obſerv'd the Partridges light in two ſeveral places, she ordered two should be ſprung (one from either place) and kill'd both with two ſeveral shots. The Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs and her Brother, could ſcarce believe what they ſaw: however they made her get into the Coach again, fearing ſo violent an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe might incommode her, and brought her back, in a manner, againſt her will.</p>
                  <p>About this time <hi>Chriſtina</hi> received Letters from <hi>Bearn,</hi> which brought her News of the Death of her Father, and the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire her Mother had to ſee her. This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd her to pray the Marchioneſs to bring her back to <hi>Saragoſa</hi> to ſpeak with her Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man about the preſent condition of her Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. At her return she was viſited by moſt that knew her: Amongſt the reſt, her Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Comrades in the Univerſity pretended a right to make Love to her. Don <hi>Philip de Palefox,</hi> formerly mentioned, was one of thoſe who appear'd moſt concern'd, to let her know they had more then ordinary kindneſs for her. Amidſt all theſe pretenders, she
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:135663:16"/> preſerv'd her uſual indifferency. Don <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> not diſcourag'd by the ſmall Progreſs of his Amours, fancy'd he might better pleaſe her with a Serenade which he gave her. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> who was not of the humour of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ladies, who all love this kind of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, was ſo angry at the noiſe it made in the Street, where two or three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were abus'd on this occaſion, that ſhe would not ſee Don
<hi>Philip</hi> any more, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to any perſon, no not to the Marqueſs who lov'd her with the greateſt reſpect. Being thus depriv'd of the ſight of her, and not able to bear ſo killing a loſs, he inquir'd and learnt the cauſe of her anger, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to demand ſatisfaction from Don <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> and did it with a great deal of courage, but ſo little ſucceſs, that he received two dangerous Wounds, and lay at the Mercy of his Rival, who taking his advantage, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd him to quit all pretence to <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> The Marqueſs chuſing rather to loſe his life than his Miſtreſs, Don <hi>Philip</hi> diſarm'd, and left him. The Marchioneſs <hi>d' Oſſeyra</hi> ſeeing her Son in that condition, knowing
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> was the cauſe of the Quarrel, was extreamly offended with her. The Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs <hi>d' Aytona,</hi> came to her, endeavouring to comfort and divert her from the violent reſolutions ſhe would have taken againſt <hi>Chriſtina;</hi> but could not prevail with her to forbear ſending Don <hi>Lorenzo</hi> word, that if <hi>Chriſtina</hi> ſtaid longer in <hi>Spain,</hi> ſhe would ſet fire on his Houſe. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for her return, haſtened her Journey
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:135663:17"/> for <hi>Bearn;</hi> and coming home, was received by her Mother with a great deal of joy, as far as the different Paſſions of Joy for ſight of her beloved Daughter, and ſorrow for her Son, would allow her.</p>
                  <p>All the Perſons of Quality in that Country complemented her at her return, and ſeveral thought her ſo Amiable, that in leſs than a Month ſhe had many very advantageous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of Marriage: Her Mother had partly made a Promiſe of her to a Gentleman, one of the moſt conſiderable in thoſe parts. But <hi>Chriſtina</hi> who lov'd her liberty, whether ſhe had a ſecret inclination for the Marqueſs, or a natural averſion from Marriage, declar'd ſhe would not put her ſelf under a Maſter; and ſince ſhe was now in a Country where thoſe of her Sex are no Slaves, ſhe would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy her privilege. The moſt concern'd, thought to overcome her with diligence of attendance, and would not be diſcourag'd, till they found ſhe was indifferent for all, and made no account of their ſervices. In the mean time, the Marqueſs
<hi>d'Oſſeyra</hi> being cur'd of his Wounds, and hearing his Miſtreſs was gone, was very much afflicted with the News, and would have followed her into <hi>France,</hi> but for fear of diſpleaſing her. He order'd one of his Family to paſs the <hi>Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nees,</hi> and carry a Letter (he gave him) to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina,</hi> which probably was full of tender and paſſionate Expreſſions: (I wiſh it in my power to have pleaſur'd you with the Copy.) But the Marchioneſs, his Mother, having diſcover'd the Intrigue, caus'd her Sons Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:135663:17"/> to be ſtaid by the way, and the Letter to be burnt; and oblig'd him with fearful threats to tell her Son, his Miſtreſs was Married, and had ſacrificed his Letter to her Husband, who having read it, threw it in the fire. The paſſionate Marqueſs was ſo vext at the News, it almoſt coſt him his life: At laſt, at the perſwaſion of his Friends, he went to <hi>Madrid,</hi> where Ambition quickly juſtled out Love, as uſually happens to the misfortune of Ladies. Don <hi>Philip</hi> was better ſerv'd, for having ſent a truſty Meſſenger to <hi>Bearn,</hi> to know whether the News he had heard of the Marriage were true, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd ſhe was not Marry'd; and that ſhe went very often a-Hunting, as the greateſt pleaſure ſhe took. This made him think of ſtealing her; and the rather, becauſe he was of Opinion there was no winning of her by fair means: A Man of that Country, whom he gain'd by his Liberality, offer'd to be his Guide, and repreſented the matter ſo eaſie, that Don
<hi>Philip</hi> reſolv'd to put his deſign in Execution. Accompanied with this Man, and two others well mounted, he paſt the Mountains, and the third day in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing came to a Village near <hi>Mayence;</hi> and that leſs notice might be taken of his Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, he ſent the two Perſons who bore him company to lodge in another Inn: the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row betimes his Guide was in the Field, and brought him news that <hi>Chriſtina</hi> would not ſtir abroad that day; and that the next day ſhe was to viſit a Kinſman, within a League of her Houſe. Don <hi>Philip</hi> having inform'd himſelf
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:135663:18"/> of the way ſhe was to take, and knowing pretty near what time she would ſet out, gave his Men order to advance ſoftly, and keep the Road: a moment after he followed with his Guide, having taken his Meaſures ſo right, that he arriv'd preciſely as
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> was paſſing by, attended only with a Foot-boy. As ſoon as Don
<hi>Philip</hi> ſaw her, he was ſo troubled and aſſaulted at once with Paſſions of ſo different Natures, that he was upon the point of altering his Reſolution, and begging her pardon for the rashneſs of his Attempt. The ſuddenneſs of the accident had a ſuitable effect on
<hi>Chriſtina,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſuſpected his deſign; and he as quickly put her out of doubt, when he told her as she was returning back, upon pretence to receive him at her Houſe, that he was come to take her back into <hi>Spain,</hi> where he could not live without her; aſſuring her, he would Marry her as ſoon as they got thither. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> by a readineſs of Wit, natural to many of her Sex, concealing her ſurprize, look'd ſmiling upon him, and told him she was very ſenſible of the greatneſs of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for her, and was ready to go back with him to <hi>Spain,</hi> to receive the Honour (he was pleas'd to promiſe) of being Marry'd to him; only she pray'd him to allow her ſo much time as was requiſite for executing a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of that Nature with decency. Don <hi>Philip</hi> credulous as true Lovers are, was Charm'd at the good Fortune, to ſee himſelf not oblig'd to uſe force, but hoped he might enjoy her without offering any violence: He
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:135663:18"/> flatter'd himſelf she lov'd him; and quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a deſign Deſpair had ingag'd him in, he willingly imbraced all Expedients she propos'd. They went to <hi>Meyrac,</hi> where <hi>Chriſtina</hi> ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with joy for having eſcap'd ſo great danger, made as if she were extremely concern'd to have him well entertain'd; and under that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, diſpatch'd two or three of her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to pray three or four Neighbours to come in all haſt to
<hi>Meyrac.</hi> They all came in the Evening, and were much ſurpriz'd at the ſtrangeneſs of the Adventure; and animated by an indiſcreet Zeal, and the anger of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, agreed upon reſolutions very violent, and contrary to the Laws of Hoſpitality. But <hi>Chriſtina</hi> being of the humour of moſt Women, who ſeldom hate thoſe that love them, though they love not again, and weary already with the noyſe she had made in the world, could not be induced to conſent to a cruel Revenge of a deſign undertaken for love of her, but was content to go into Don <hi>Philip</hi>'s Chamber, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſome Gentlemen of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, and tell him she had no ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for his Perſon, but could not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to Marry. With that she retir'd, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void hearing the reproaches of a Lover, who after she was gone, could not forbear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of her; and thoſe who accompanied her thither, told him harshly enough he muſt be gone. He return'd in a deſperate mood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Inn where he had left his People, made them get haſtily on Horſeback, and rode all Night, deteſting his Paſſion no leſs than his Credulity. Not long after he addreſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,

<hi>Chriſtina,</hi> who had her share of the trouble occaſioned by this Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the fright the <hi>Spaniard</hi> put her in, and the importunity of Suitors, whoſe Paſſion was awakned by the accident, and put them upon new and preſſing Addreſſes to her. Her Mother and Relations made uſe of it, to perſwade her to Marry <hi>Marmon,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of great Merit, who had long endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to gain her, and had his Eſtate conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently ſeated near hers. This buſineſs was believ'd of ſo much advantage to both, and the Relations on either ſide deſired it ſo earneſtly, that Articles of Marriage were drawn upon the aſſurance the Barroneſs gave to prevail with her Daughter to conſent: But <hi>Marmon</hi> being informed how much they preſs'd her, went to ſee her, and having complain'd of her indifference, aſſur'd her, he was ready to ſet her at liberty from any Engagement she might be conceived under to him, and would endeavour to merit her by ſuch ſervices as he thought moſt accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to her. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> who had not before vouchſafed him an anſwer, obſerving his ſentiments ſo full of reſpect, declar'd to him she had no averſion againſt his Perſon, tho a ſtrong one againſt Marriage, and was reſolv'd to prefer her liberty before all other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; but if it should be her fortune one day to loſe it, she should be glad to ſacrifice it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:135663:19"/> to a perſon who appear'd ſo reaſonable. He was ſatisfi'd with her anſwer, and pray'd his Relations to ſpeak no more of the buſineſs, but give him time to win her by his ſervices. He waited on her thenceforward with a great deal of diligence, but with ſo much diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (not ſpeaking a word of Love) that she received all his Viſits with much ſatisfaction, and had a real Eſteem (though no Love) for him.</p>
                  <p>One Afternoon she had been abroad with <hi>Marmon</hi> a-shooting Quails with a Croſs-bow without a Gun; a great Maſtiff ſet upon her Setting-Dog: she preſently ran in to force the Maſtiff to let go his hold, which he too quickly did upon the firſt blow she gave him, and flying at her, bit her in the right Arm. <hi>Marmon,</hi> who was hard by, purſued the Maſtiff; and having overtaken him, preſently diſpatch'd him, though not without being bitten by him. He had ſcarce laid him dead, but he ſpy'd two or three Countrymen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Guns in purſuit of the Maſtiff, who told him it was a Mad Dog, and had already bit three or four.
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> was ſo frighted at the News, she was ready to ſink; and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting haſtily home, ſent for an able Phyſician of the Neighbourhood, who according to the Cuſtom of thoſe of the Profeſſion, made ſlight of the matter, and undertook to cure her in few days, and ordered her ſeveral Remedies for the purpoſe. <hi>Marmon</hi> was ſo tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they doubted he would run Mad; for a long time he obſtinately refuſed to take any thing, imagining if he could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Some days after their hurts, there was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that a Woman bit by the ſame Dog was run Mad, and that they were forced to ſmother her. They would have conceal'd this News from them; but
<hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s Mother having heard it, was ſo alarm'd that in ſpite of the Phyſicians and their Medicines, ſhe reſolved to take her Daughter to <hi>Bayonne,</hi> to dip her in the Sea, as a Sovereign Remedy in the caſe. <hi>Marmon</hi> would make one of the Company, more for the pleaſure of attending his Miſtreſs, than for the Cure. The morrow after their arrival the Ladies were viſited by moſt of the Perſons of Quality in the Town. The Viſcount
<hi>Ronceval,</hi> then at <hi>Bayonne,</hi> was one of the firſt to pay them his Civilities: He was of a good Family, of a haughty humour, and Mein, and had a conſiderable Eſtate in the Country of <hi>Beſque:</hi> But he had the intoleta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vanity to think he did a Lady Honour, if he took the pains to come near her. The firſt time he ſaw <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> thought her ſo Amiable, he reſolved to ſee her often; the ſecond Viſit amus'd him, and fill'd him full of Amorous Inclinations: and having been a whole Week without ſeeing her, being in a Courſe of Phyſick, his Fancy had the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to repreſent her to his thoughts to the utmoſt advantage. The third Viſit he made
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:135663:20"/> her, he went with a reſolution to declare his Love, but did not, having not been able to find her alone; but he return'd home up to the Ears in Love, which may be reckon'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Triumphs of <hi>Cupid.</hi> The morrow he deſired to ſpeak with her before eight in the Morning, but was put off till the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. The Ladies had ſcarce dined but he came in, and happily finding <hi>Chriſtina</hi> in her Chamber alone, he began with telling her he had brought her the beſt News ſhe ever heard. This Lady, who took ſingular delight to hear News, and was paſſionately concern'd for the Progreſs of the Victorious Arms of <hi>France,</hi> fancy'd ſhe ſhould hear from him of ſome Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory in the Field, or the taking of <hi>Cambray,</hi> or
<hi>Valenciennes,</hi> and was upon that account very earneſt to know the News. The Viſcount ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a more than ordinary Confidence, and a Stranger to the fears incident to moſt Lovers when they are to declare their Paſſion to their Miſtreſſes, never ſtuck to tell her, that a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of great Merit and Birth, and as great a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, admir'd her and was reſolv'd to marry her. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> who little expected ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, anſwer'd, that how little ſoever he was concern'd for that Perſon, he would do well to adviſe him to think no more of that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it being more than probable that for all his great Quality and Fortune, he ſhould but loſe his time in Courting her. The Viſcount was not diſcouraged at this Anſwer, but think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe had not well underſtood him, told her, ſhe would not be ſo indifferent, did ſhe but know the Gentlemans Name. It madded him
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:135663:21"/> the while to ſee her ſo incurious, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive who it was, and himſelf depriv'd of the occaſion he expected to have from her que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, to anſwer, it was he: Were it you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies <hi>Chriſtina</hi> coldly, I had no more to ſay to you than what you have heard: 'Tis not Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, ſays the Viſcount, you should be ſo much your own Enemy, to refuſe ſuch a ſettlement as I propoſe to you: I have that exceſs of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for you, I will give you time to think on't, and doubt not but you will alter your mind when you have conſider'd the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the offer I make you. At this another coming in, he withdrew, and came two days after to know if she had tho' of the propoſal he had made her: 'Twas to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to think of it, anſwer'd she, having nothing to add to what I ſaid to you at firſt. She ſpoke theſe words ſo unconcern'd, and with ſo much ſcorn, that the preſumptuous Viſcount, not able to endure it, took his leave, and went away, telling her, ſince she made ſo ill uſe of his kindneſs, he could alter his humour. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> to be rid of his extravagant impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, gave order they should anſwer him at the door if he came again, that she was not well, and in few days return'd with her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Bearn.</hi> Every body at <hi>Bayonne</hi> admir'd her, and ſpoke well of her when gone; only the Viſcount
<hi>Ronceval</hi> haughtily publish'd, she was in Love with him, and added many ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Circumſtances to make the ſtory more probable. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> heard of it, and was touched to the quick, though 'twas told her for her comfort, the Viſcount uſually
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:135663:21"/> took that liberty, and that his Acquaintance made very little accompt of it: But this would not ſatisfie her; she was ready to take Horſe for <hi>Bayonne</hi> to punish his inſolence, wanting nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courage nor dexterity to have ſatisfaction from him; nothing but the fear of giving oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for new diſcourſe held her back. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> having had ſome confuſed account of it, reſented it with all the indignation of a paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Lover: To be clearer informed, he goes to his Miſtreſs, and finding her much out of humour, asked her the reaſon. You are the only Man in the Province (ſays she very ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly) that is ignorant of it. 'Tis ſomewhat extraordinary, a man who hath declar'd a Paſſion for me, should be the laſt that knows I have been abus'd <hi>Marmon</hi> who wanted not the moſt delicate ſentiments of a man of Honour, made her a profound Reverence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd: Two hours after he got on Horſe-back, and took the Road for <hi>Bayonne,</hi> where he was told at his arrival, the Viſcount was gone to one of his Seats in the Country a-Hunting. He reſolv'd to follow him, and found him juſt as he was going from home to a Gentleman his Neighbour to dine with him. The firſt Complements paſt, he let the Viſcount know he had buſineſs of conſequence to communicate to him, and that it would be convenient they might be private. <hi>Ronceval</hi> order'd his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to go before, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:135663:22"/> got out out of ſight, <hi>Marmon</hi> told him he was come to demand ſatisfaction of him for what he had ſaid to the diſadvantage of the moſt Charming Perſon on Earth. This ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd the Viſcount, who would have turn'd all

The heat of the firſt purſuits being over, <hi>Marmon</hi> longing impatiently to ſee his Miſtreſs, ſtole away privately to <hi>Meyrac,</hi> where he was received with all the marks of eſteem and acknowledgement he could expect from <hi>Chriſtina;</hi> who ſeeing him in trouble for a Pardon from the King, told him, it became not a man of Honour to deſire it, without having deſerv'd it: And ſince his Majeſty commanded the Armies in Perſon, it would be an eaſie matter for him to make himſelf known to that great Prince by ſome ſignal ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which might aſſure him of pardon for a reward, and was the only way to gain her Heart. He was raviſh'd to find her ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo different from the weakneſs of her
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:135663:22"/> Sex, and taking his leave, promis'd never to return till he had made it appear, he was not altogether unworthy the concern ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt for his reputation. He order'd his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs at home with all poſſible expedition, and came to <hi>Paris</hi> a little before the opening of the Compagne for the <hi>French</hi> County. Two or three of his Friends, who were Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, ſpoke ſo well of that ſervice, and the frequent advantages they had to ſignalize themſelves, that he reſolv'd to liſt himſelf in the ſecond Company, where Mounſieur <hi>Jauvelt</hi> very gladly received him, and <hi>Marmon</hi> as worthily ſerv'd him with a great deal of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and courage.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:135663:23"/> ſo many obſtacles in her way, that would have diſcouraged any other from executing ſo generous a reſolution.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:135663:24"/> that it would be impoſſible to avoid Diſcovery long, went one day to his Quarters: and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him alone, told him he deſired to be acquainted with him, and could do no leſs to requite the deſire he had expreſt on two or three occaſions to contract a Friendſhip with him. <hi>Marmon</hi> was ſtrangely ſurpriz'd at the Voice, his Heart telling him preſently 'twas <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> ſpoke to him, though his reaſon could hardly give him leave to believe it. St. <hi>Aubin</hi> ſmil'd, which put <hi>Marmon</hi> out of doubt.
<hi>May I credit my Eyes,</hi> ſays he, <hi>or is it an illuſion?</hi> St. <hi>Aubin</hi> interrupting him, declared the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives for the reſolution he had taken, charging him at his peril not to diſcover him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to be very ſenſible of the diſcretion he ſhould ſhew on this occaſion, and after they should have both gain'd credit in the ſervice they would retire together and enjoy one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the reſt of their Days: <hi>Marmon,</hi> who knew her humour, thought it to no purpoſe to endeavour making her alter her reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, told her, <hi>It was a reſolution worthy a noble Soul.</hi> He added a thouſand obliging ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and ſo very kind, St. <hi>Aubin</hi> told him he muſt alter his Language, and call him Couſin; which he promis'd to do, and obſerv'd it ſo carefully that their Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency was never perceived.</p>
                  <p>The Muſqueteers within few Days follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King to <hi>Flanders;</hi> the Campaign (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that of the taking of <hi>Limburg</hi>) was ſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably wet it would have diſcourag'd any but St. <hi>Aubin</hi> from being a Soldier. <hi>Marmon,</hi> who came often to ſee him as his Couſin, having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:135663:24"/> his Tent, found him ſo weary, he could not forbear telling him how troubled he was to ſee him drudge in that hard ſervice, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues wherof the ableſt Men were ſcarce able to endure. His diſcourſe on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was ſo tender and paſſionate, that a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier who overheard them through the Tent-Cloths, came briskly in, and gave them cauſe, by his expreſſions to believe he ſuſpected the words he had heard <hi>Marmon</hi> ſpeak, could not be addreſs'd but to a Maid. St. <hi>Aubin</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it, anſwered, his fooliſh Couſin there, was ſo deeply in Love he could not abſtain from diſcourſing of it, and repeating to him what he had ſaid to his Miſtreſs; and with that, turning to
<hi>Marmon,</hi> I would adviſe you, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, to write to her, ſaith St. <hi>Aubin: Marmon</hi> anſwer'd, Matters were not yet ripe for wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and he durſt not do it; the Soldier believed all this true, and preſently went out. St. <hi>Aubin</hi> took that occaſion to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to <hi>Marmon</hi> the Inconveniences might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen if he us'd diſcourſe of that Nature, and charg'd him not to ſpeak a word to him during the Campaign, but as to his Couſin.</p>
                  <p>The News about this time was, that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies fearing the approach of the K march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed further off, and retir'd into their Countries, giving out (to amuſe the People) they would go beſiege
<hi>Maeſtricht.</hi> This obliged his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to ſend thither a detachment of his Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers under the command of Monſieur <hi>Jau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velle;</hi> thoſe Gallants being all willing to go upon that ſervice, in hopes to ſee the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my quickly. To prevent diſcontent, the King
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:135663:25"/> was oblig'd to take the fourth Man of every rank till they made up the number deſir'd. It was St. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s Fortune to be detach'd, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, and
<hi>Marmon</hi>'s to be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; he ran to the firſt Company to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how his Couſin ſped, and to his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vexation heard he was of the number of the detach'd. <hi>Marmon,</hi> unwilling to part with him, pray'd ſeveral of his Comrades to give him their place, pretending he had buſineſs of Conſequence with a Captain of the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>Maeſtricht:</hi> But he was ſo unfortunate, or thoſe Companies were compoſed of young Gentlemen ſo paſſionately ambitious of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, he could not find one willing to loſe ſo promiſing an occaſion to ſignalize himſelf. Part they muſt, and <hi>Marmon</hi> remained under ſuch a conſternation, nothing for a long time could comfort him. The mean time the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment arriv'd at <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> where the Marſhal <hi>d' Eſtrade</hi> joyfully receiv'd them; tho' till then, no Soldiers had been quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the principal Burgers, on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion no Man was exempted.</p>
                  <p>An Officer of the Town who gave out the billets, to take away all cauſe of complaint, ſaid, he would quarter a Muſqueteer at his Houſe: And having ſpy'd St. <hi>Aubin</hi> ſlipt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hand a billet for his Houſe, fancying a young Man ſo handſome could not but be of a very quiet temper, and complying hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. This Burgher was very rich, and had to Wife one of the handſomeſt Women of the Town; and a Siſter, whoſe Beauty and Fortune had made a great number of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:135663:25"/> Officers her Servants. Theſe Women having heard thoſe of their acquaintance tell of the diſorders Soldiers uſually commit in their quarters, trembled at the thoughts of having one in their Houſe. But they muſt have one quarter'd with them, and they had taken their Fortune for the Man, and reſolved to uſe him the beſt they could. St.
<hi>Aubin</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to their Houſe with a Billet in his Hand, they came down to receive him, and were ſo pleaſingly ſurpriz'd with the ſight of him, (capable to move the moſt indifferent to have kindneſs for him) that they could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear viewing him with aſtoniſhment, and applauding in their Hearts their very good Fortune: His obliging way of Diſcourſe, and the excuſes he made that he was forc'd to trouble them, abſolutely gain'd him their Hearts. And to let him preſently ſee the eſteem they had for him, they gave him the beſt Chamber in the Houſe, tho' deſign'd for another. It was very richly furniſh'd, and St.
<hi>Aubin</hi> after long excuſes the contrary, was forced to lie there. The Maſter of the Houſe having made proviſion of ſome Bottles of Rheniſh Wine to Welcome his new Gueſt, was angry to find him as ſober at Table, as modeſt every where elſe. St. <hi>Aubin</hi> had not been two days there, but his Hoſteſs was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately in Love with him: Her Siſter
<hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi> had very kind thoughts for him, and having twice or thrice in his Company re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make Conqueſt of him; her Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors had ſo often told her ſhe was amiable, and her Glaſs confirm'd it ſo well, that ſhe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:135663:26"/> doubted not of ſucceſs when ſhe ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply her ſelf to gain Love. Theſe two fair Ones had no other diſcourſe but of the new Beauties they diſcover'd every moment in the face and wit of their new Gueſt, and he very glad of ſo pretty an amuſement, ſpent whole days at home, to divert himſelf with them at ſome little witty Games he taught them, with a penalty impos'd on thoſe who did not well. They took occaſion to commend his Complaiſance before the Maſter of the Houſe, who was raviſh'd to find his Gueſt ſo well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, as to apply himſelf for their divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And when his Wife was out at play, he never fail'd, for her penalty, to require her to kiſs the Muſqueteer; which ſhe was ſo pleas'd with, ſhe never minded her Game, that ſhe might by her faults have the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to kiſs him the oftner; and the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in good humour, would ſometimes ſay he would excuſe his Wife, ſhould ſhe be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful to him, to pleaſure a perſon of ſo good a Meen.
<hi>Rachel,</hi> who apply'd her ſelf par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to pleaſe him, was diſtracted to ſee Saint <hi>Aubin</hi> pleas'd with thoſe ſmall Penan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces undergone with her Siſter, without expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any preference for her, and became ſo jealous of him ſhe reſolved to make him jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous too. To effect this, ſhe ſent for a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the Garriſon, who had long been in love with her. St. <hi>Aubin</hi> being excellent Company, was very glad to ſee him, and grew ſo intimate with him, that in a ſhort time the Gentleman ſtill made one amongſt them in all their divertiſements. It madded
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:135663:26"/> 
                     <hi>Rachel</hi> to ſee St. <hi>Aubin,</hi> not only unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as formerly, but very earneſt to have the Gentleman ſent for, when he ſtaid away long; ſo that ſhe reſolv'd to quarrel with him, that ſhe might no more be troubled with him. The Muſqueteer very glad of an Aſſiſtant to bear the Women Company, and deſirous to have him continued, when he found the difference between <hi>Rachel</hi> and the Gentleman, interpos'd to reconcile them. The Amorous <hi>Rachel,</hi> not able to deny him any thing, granted his requeſt. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who, notwithſtanding the Civilities of his Friend, ſuſpected he might be his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, was ſo ſenſible of the obligation, that he acquainted him with his Paſſion for
<hi>Rachel.</hi> St. <hi>Aubin,</hi> in requital of the confidence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd him all the ſervice in his power. The Siſters, the mean time, obſerving they were both in Love with their Gueſt, watch'd one another narrowly, and if he chanc'd to let fall a kind expreſſion for the one, he was preſently call'd to account for it by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And if he ſtirr'd a quarter of an hour out of doors, he was to expect a ſtrict exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination at his return, what he had been a doing. Thus far they held a fair Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence, and conceal'd nothing from each other. The Married Siſter being bolder than <hi>Rachel,</hi> to prevent and engage her in her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, or at leaſt diſcourage her from daring to declare her love for St. <hi>Aubin,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted her with the kindneſs ſhe had for him, deſiring her Aſſiſtance to make him ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of it, when ſhe found a favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:135663:27"/> to do it handſomely. <hi>Rachel</hi> very dextrouſly hiding her jealouſie, and glad of the diſcovery her Siſter had made her, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd her ſecreſie and aſſiſtance. Her Siſter to make advantage of the good temper ſhe appear'd in, deſir'd her to do it that very day; and told her, that to the end ſhe might hear their diſcourſe without bluſhing, and be a Witneſs of the ſervice ſhe would do her, ſhe would ſtand behind the Hanging, and take notice of all. This put <hi>Rachel</hi> in ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, but ſhe muſt diſſemble and hide it the beſt ſhe can. Her Siſter had St. <hi>Aubin</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up, and had poſted her ſelf behind the Hanging; and as loth as <hi>Rachel</hi> was to ſpeak for any but her ſelf, it muſt be done. The Muſqueteer being entred the Room, after half a quarter of an hours diſcourſe, ſhe extoll'd his Merit and good Meen, and told him, that having ſo many good qualities, he muſt not be ſupriz'd to hear a handſome Woman, and one he ſaw every day had ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d inclinations for him. St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin</hi> muſing at this, <hi>Rachel</hi> told him, he need only take good notice of her Siſter, and he might read in her looks the truth of what ſhe ſaid. St. <hi>Aubin</hi> tir'd with their forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which he had hitherto wittily diverted, anſwer'd her in general, that from the day he firſt came to their Houſe, he found himſelf extreamly oblig'd to both the Siſters, and wiſh'd himſelf in a better condition to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his acknowledgments.
<hi>Rachel</hi> would have broken off there, but remembring her
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:135663:27"/> Siſter was near, ſhe preſs'd further, to draw him to a more poſitive anſwer; and to bring him to it, magnifi'd the Charms of her Siſter: You are pleas'd to be merry, ſays St. <hi>Aubin;</hi> but ſince we are fallen on this ſubject, you will give me leave to inform you of a Paſſion as real, as that you tell me of is imaginary. <hi>Rachel</hi> making no doubt but he ſpoke of himſelf, was mortally afraid her Rival ſhould hear the Declaration ſhe thought he would make: And to ſave her the trouble of it, would have preſently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, but for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fear of diſcouraging him, ſhe alter'd her mind. Her Brother coming lucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in, help'd her out of the perplexity ſhe was in, but not out of the impatience ſhe was under, to hear the Declaration expected. Not long after ſhe found him alone, and inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fell into the diſcourſe he begun when the Brother interrupted them. St.
<hi>Aubin</hi> very glad to ſerve his Friend, ſpoke ſo much to the Gentlemans advantage, and deſcrib'd to the life the Paſſion he had for her, that <hi>Rachel</hi> could not forbear ſighing out, <hi>Cruel Man that you are, how is it poſſible you that have ſo little ſenſe of Love, ſhould ſo powerfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade others to it?</hi> She was ſo aſham'd, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving let fall theſe words, that ſhe retired, without giving him time to anſwer; and griev'd at heart for his inſenſibility, ſhe gave free paſſage to her tears, the uſual comfort of thoſe of her Sex. Her Siſter, who ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every moment how to conquer his obſtinate indifference, thought to do it by her libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:135663:28"/> St. <hi>Aubin</hi> not ſo well able to diſguiſe as his Sex, or not ſo careful to do it, had often ſaid he admir d the rare Workmanſhip of ſome Table Linnen ſhe had ſhown him: She preſented him with it; and though he made very ſhy of accepting it, ſhe pray'd him ſo earneſtly, on pretence he might have need of it in the Army, that ſhe forc'd him to take it. After this ſhe would have made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother preſent of a Locket of Diamonds, which ſhe could not perſwade him to receive, but he could not refuſe a very curious Toi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette
<hi>Rachel</hi> beſtow'd on him. There was news about that time, that the Commander of the Muſqueteers had Order from the King to lead his Detachment to <hi>Paris.</hi> This put
<hi>Rachel</hi> and her Siſter in a fearful Conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The latter was pretty well ſatisfied, becauſe her Rival being the handſomer and younger, had met with no better Fortune than ſhe: But <hi>Rachel</hi> was ſo troubled at it, the very thoughts of St. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s abſence almoſt diſtracted her; and judging no misfortune equal to that of loſſing him, ſhe cast about how to keep him near her. The Orders for their marching ſuddenly away, afflicted her extreamly; for believing ſhe had fortune large enough to make her a Muſqueteers Wife, ſhe made no doubt out St. <hi>Aubin</hi> would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly marry her, could ſhe but have time to get her Friends conſent, who were already under ſome Ingagement of marrying her to a young Man of
<hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. But not daring to expoſe her Love
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:135663:28"/> to the uncertain ſucceſs of a haſty Negotiation, ſhe took a reſolution, the moſt hardy and bold a perſon of her Sex cou'd be capable of, and pray'd her Brother to go along with her to her Uncle, who was her Guardian. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone with them two, who were her neareſt Relations, and intruſted to diſpoſe of her, ſhe fell down at their feet; and having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to ſweeten them by a Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble not much to the purpoſe, ſhe declared to them ſhe had been ſo unfortunate, as to yield to St. <hi>Aubin,</hi> upon his Promiſe to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her, but was afraid he would leave her without making her his Wife: that ſhe had rather die than live diſhonour'd, and begg'd their pardon, and that at the ſame time they would diſpatch her out of the World, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford her their neceſſary aſſiſtances to make him repair her Honour.</p>
                  <p>The Brother having a real eſteem for St. <hi>Aubin,</hi> could have been very well content to have him for his Brother in-law, and excus'd his Siſter ſo well, that the Uncle, who had threatned to forſake her, joyn'd with them to agree upon the means to ſettle the Affair.
<hi>Rachel</hi> blind with Paſſion, told them the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to do it, was to ſurprize them a-bed together, and perſwade or force him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to marry her. This appear'd ſo eaſie they promis'd to do it; and having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed of the time to put it in execution, <hi>Rachel</hi> at the hour went into St. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s Chamber, and having found him a-bed (as ſhe had fore-caſt) ſhe threw off her Night-gown
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:135663:29"/> and laid her by him, telling him, if he thought her too forward in doing thus, he muſt thank himſelf, who had put her in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to conſider neither what was decent nor reaſonable. St. <hi>Aubin</hi> would have got out of Bed, and would not have been ſtaid there, but for the noiſe the Uncle and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made as they entred the Chamber with Piſtols in their Hands: they came to the Bed-ſide, and having drawn the Curtain, found, to their aſtoniſhment, the Bed-fellows were both of a Sex; and <hi>Rachel</hi> perceiving her miſtake in having lov'd a Woman, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſguiſe of a Muſqueteer, was ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to that extremity, ſhe could hardly be brought to her ſelf: But convinc'd by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, ſhe confeſt to her Relations, that the fear ſhe had to loſe that lovely Maid, whom ſhe thought a Man, had ſeiz'd her with that violence, that to aſſure her ſelf of him, ſhe forced her ſelf to declare he had robb'd her of her Honour. St. <hi>Aubin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded at the Adventure, inſtantly begg'd them to keep it ſecret, telling them how much he was concern'd it ſhould not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd; and adding, he would be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of them if they divulged it. They were oblig'd to ſilence by common Intereſt, and the Muſqueteers marching away the next day, St.
<hi>Aubin</hi> ſaw himſelf at liberty, and well-rid of the Raileries and Reproaches of his Hoſteſſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:135663:29"/>At his return to <hi>Paris,</hi> he ſaw <hi>Marmon,</hi> who long'd for his coming; and to pleaſe him, St. <hi>Aubin</hi> made him a faithful Relation of what he had ſeen ſince parting, not forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the leaſt Circumſtance of what happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Maſtricht. Marmon</hi> took occaſion to renew his requeſt, that she would ſave her ſelf thoſe toilſome Fatigues, and appear in a habit ſuitable to her Sex, if she could not reſume the inclinations proper to it. St. <hi>Aubin</hi> to oblige him, promiſed after one Campaign more to retire, being unwilling to quit the ſervice without engaging an Enemy, for which this Campaign had not afforded opportunity.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Aubin</hi> being quarter'd at the <hi>Hoſtel de Noſtre Dame,</hi> the Baron of
<hi>Quincy,</hi> who lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, ſurpris'd at the good account St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin</hi> gave of the Campaign, deſired to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him; and having made ſome Overtures for the purpoſe, found the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteer ſo glad of it, that they became very good Friends. The Baron, little acquainted with the Women of <hi>Paris,</hi> went to a <hi>Flemiſh</hi> ladies houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who attended a ſuit of Law there, and preſenting St. <hi>Aubin</hi> to her, as a Perſon of Merit, ſpoke much to his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. This Lady being the Marchioneſs <hi>de Belabre,</hi> judging all other things ſuitable to St. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s good Meen, received him very kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and gave the Baron thanks for bringing him to her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:135663:30"/>The Lady was ſo pleas'd with this firſt Viſit, that St. <hi>Aubin</hi> return'd frequently thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſometimes with the Baron, and often without him, much delighted with the Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Converſation of the Marchioneſs. Theſe Viſits gave him opportunity of being acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with two or three Gentlemen of the beſt Quality; it was the time of the
<hi>Carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,</hi> and one night they deſir'd the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to go to a Ball: She refus'd it at firſt as a thing improper for one Lady to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with three Men. One preſently told her she need only dreſs St. <hi>Aubin</hi> in Maids Habit, which could not chuſe but become him well enough, being ſo pretty a Youth. This was ſo generally approv'd, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs preſently took St. <hi>Aubin</hi> by the hand, led him into her Wardrobe, where she gave him a Maids Habit very fit for him, and went out to give St. <hi>Aubin</hi> time to dreſs himſelf, and return'd by and by to put him on a Tour. This Dreſs appear'd ſo natural and agreeable to his Countenance and Stature, that the Marchioneſs and Gentlemen admir'd it. They went to ſeveral Balls, and were very well received. They were told there was one at Monſieur
<hi>Strasbourg</hi>'s, where was very good Company: thither they went, and found ſo great a number of Perſons of Quality, they could ſcarce get entrance. Monſieur <hi>Stras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> Who had heard talk of the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Belabre,</hi> and was told it was she, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her with a great deal of Civility; and ſeeing her Companion very handſome, he ſpoke to one of the Company to take her
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:135663:30"/> forth to Dance, which she did ſo well, that the Marchioneſs and her Company were migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſurpriz'd. Every one took her for a <hi>Flemin,</hi> and made no further inquiry. The Baron of <hi>Angoſſe</hi> being at this Ball, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred he had ſeen her at
<hi>Bayonne,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken a ſtrict view of her, knew her to be <hi>Madamoiſelle d' Meyrac:</hi> He came to her, and Complemented, telling her how glad he was to ſee her at

The Marchioneſs, and the Gentleman who Uſher'd her, laugh'd at the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, and were extremely well pleas'd at the good ſucceſs of St. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s diſguiſe. <hi>D' Angoſſe</hi> perceiving they laugh'd at his miſtake, and concern'd to find the truth, went down to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for the Marchioneſſes Servants, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found one of them, pray'd him to let him know the Gentlewomans Name who was with his Lady. The <hi>Fleming</hi> for anſwer laugh'd in his Face, and ſo heartily, 'twas long e're he could ſpeak: At length he told him 'twas a Boy in Maids Habit. <hi>D' Angoſſe</hi> returned to the Dancing-room, and making up cloſe to that handſome Perſon, told him he had now learnt what he was; but that all who ſaw him in that Habit, and knew the Gentlewoman he had ſpoken to him of, would have certainly miſtaken him for her; and that if he were minded to divert himſelf, he might meet with many pleaſant

<hi>Aubin</hi> thank'd him, and ſaid very coldly, he was not of an humour to deceive any Body. Preſently after the Ball ended, and all return'd. The Marchioneſs was ſo pleas'd with this Nights Adventures, ſhe pray'd the Gentlemen, eſpecially St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin,</hi> to come again, and go on the like Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. But <hi>Marmon</hi> having heard by one of his Country-men, that there was ſeen at a Ball a young <hi>Fleming,</hi> the very Picture of <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> and that ever ſince, two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Be rn,</hi> run with <hi>d' Angoſſe</hi> all over the Town, from one Ball to another, to meet him, he went to his Couſin St. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him the news. St. <hi>Aubin</hi> to diſabuſe him, acquainted him with all that paſs'd at Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Strasbourg</hi>'s; and that he might hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely diſingage himſelf from viſiting the Marchioneſs, he feign'd himſelf ſick. By this time <hi>Lent</hi> was come, and preparation muſt be made for the Campaign. The King notwithſtanding the rigour of the ſeaſon, ſet out the fifth of <hi>April</hi> to Beſiege <hi>Conde,</hi> and the Morrow after he arriv'd in the Camp, the Trenches were open'd. Three days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Muſqueteers were commanded to take a half-Moon, and behaved themſelves ſo brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that having beat off the Enemy, they entred the Town, which was taken by Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, and not by Compoſition, as many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev d His Majeſty's Clemency (who was content to make the Troops he found in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon Priſoners of War, without taking the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:135663:31"/> advantages of Victory againſt thoſe unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Perſons who did their duty very well) rais'd that report. St. <hi>Aubin</hi> and <hi>Marmon</hi> ſignaliz'd themſelves in this ſervice; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer received a ſlight wound in the Arm, and
<hi>Marmon</hi> had the good fortune to take Priſoner an <hi>Italian</hi> Captain, whom he ſeiz'd by his hair: And having been ſhot in the Arm, he held him faſt with the other, and brought him to the King, who was at the Head of the Trenches. His Majeſty having commended the Action, promiſed to have a particular care of his Fortune, and ordered they ſhould be very careful of his Cure.</p>
                  <p>The morrow all the wounded men were carried to <hi>Fournay,</hi> and <hi>Marmon</hi> much more troubled for his Couſins Wound than his own, had the ſatisfaction to ſee it was not dangerous; and St. <hi>Aubin</hi> told him he would not have gone to <hi>Fournay</hi> but to take care of him, expreſſing extreme ſatisfaction to have been an Eye-witneſs of his Valour in this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <hi>Marmon</hi> taking advantage of ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable an occaſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> minded St.
<hi>Aubin</hi> of his promiſe to recompence his perſeverance if ſupported by ſome glorious action. St. <hi>Aubin</hi> without giving him leave to finiſh, pray'd him only to have a care of being cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as ſoon as poſſible, aſſuring him he was very ſenſible of his misfortune, and had a very great eſteem for him, adding (for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort) other very obliging diſcourſe. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> was ſo well pleaſed with it, thoſe that ſaw him ſaid he was viſibly much better:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:135663:32"/> However it was his fate to die two days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as moſt of thoſe did who had been hurt at the Siege, tho' their Wounds appeared not dangerous. St. <hi>Aubin</hi> who was almoſt well of his Wound was ſo troubled for <hi>Marmon</hi>'s Death, that he reſolved to continue in the ſervice to avoid the reproaches of <hi>Marmon</hi>'s Friends who knew St.
<hi>Aubin</hi> had ingaged him to liſt himſelf a Soldier, and would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly lay the loſs of him to his charge. The grief this put him to, occaſion'd by ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination and a great deal of eſteem and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment he had for <hi>Marmon,</hi> retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his cure and kept him long at <hi>Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Baron of <hi>Quincy</hi> having Commiſſion to raiſe a Regiment of Horſe at
<hi>Fournay,</hi> met St. <hi>Aubin</hi> at the Governours; where he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him a great deal of civility, and finding him ſomewhat unwilling to go again among the Muſqueteers becauſe of his Couſin's Death, offer'd him a Company in his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. St. <hi>Aubin</hi> accepted it, and aſſiſted the Colonel in making the Levies, the Regiment was not long in raiſing; the Baron who for good Reaſons had lately quitted the ſervice of <hi>Spain,</hi> having given notice to the Officers of his Regiment in Garriſon at <hi>Mons,</hi> that he was raiſing a new one for the ſervice of <hi>France,</hi> and thoſe under his command when he ſerved <hi>Spain,</hi> were ſo ſatisfied with his perſon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, that moſt of the Troops and ſeveral of the Officers deſerted the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to meet their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel at <hi>Fournay.</hi> This Regiment being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of men of that Country, who were better
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:135663:32"/> acquainted than ſtrangers with the Roads, was frequently imployed upon Parties: they acquitted themſelves ſo well, that they never fail'd of certain News of the Enemy upon occaſion. St. <hi>Aubin</hi> always ambitious of Glory, having had good ſucceſs in two or three Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, never fail'd to make one among them though he were not commanded. The
<hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> vext at the advantages daily gain'd by the <hi>French</hi> Parties, eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>'s Regiment, that the Governour of <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciennes</hi> had order to lay an ambuſcade for them; and did it ſo effectually, that of a party of thirty nine Troopers commanded by a Lieutenant, twenty two were taken, and the reſt kill'd or fled. St.
<hi>Aubin</hi> who ſerv'd there as a Volunteer was one of the Priſoners: they were all carried to the Army, where the Duke <hi>De Villa Hermoſa</hi> who was gone to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> had left the Marqueſs <hi>d' Oſſeyra</hi> general of the Artillery Commander in chief in his abſence. The Marqueſs called a Council of War, to adviſe what ſhould be done to the Priſoners, ſeveral of which, and particularly the Lieutenant, who commanded them were known to be deſerters. It was reſolved the Troopers (on condition they would ſerve <hi>Spain</hi> again) ſhould be pardoned, as having been debauch'd by their Officers. But as for the Officers, for terrour to others, they were all condemned to be hang'd as Deſerters. St. <hi>Aubin,</hi> though not taken in that quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was carried away as involved in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, the Troopers having declared he was an Officer: The Council being broke
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:135663:33"/> up, they ſent a Confeſſor to every one of the condemn'd. St.
<hi>Aubin</hi> was frighted at the Horror of ſo ſhameful a Death, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape it, was upon the Point of declaring who he was; yet he could not find in his heart to expoſe himſelf to be laught at by the whole Army, his modeſty prevailing over his fear; he prepar'd for Death with an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Courage. The Army was drawn up in <hi>Battalia,</hi> and theſe unfortunate Priſoners were brought to the Gibbet: The Lieutenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hang'd, St. <hi>Aubin</hi> frightned at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of ſo infamous a Death, deſired to ſpeak with the General, who to give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to ſo exemplary a Puniſhment coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced it with his preſence. The Marqueſs approached him, and ſurpriz'd at the good meen of the Criminal, whoſe face he thought himſelf not altogether a ſtranger to, he heard him with compaſſion. St. <hi>Aubin</hi> ſo clearly made out the injuſtice they would have done him, by violating the Law of War in his Perſon, who had never been in the ſervice of <hi>Spain,</hi> that the Officers fearful of like u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, if taken by the <hi>French</hi> began to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur. The Marqueſs perceiving it, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing a mutiny should rob him of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſaving St. <hi>Aubin,</hi> haſten'd the ſetting him at liberty.</p>
                  <p>The Army was ſo ſatisfied with this piece of Juſtice, ſcarce any Officer of Note but waited on the Marqueſs to give him thanks: And as we uſually love thoſe we have obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the General was ſo pleas'd with his ſaving St. <hi>Aubin,</hi> that he took him to his Quarters,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:135663:33"/> and finding he had all Accomplishments of a Perſon of Quality, he kept him in his Houſe, and treated him with all the kindneſs and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem he could have shew'd the beſt of his Friends. The Marqueſs being the ſame who had been in Love with
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> at <hi>Saragoſa,</hi> was ſo chang'd ſince that time, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiz'd by his great <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Muſtaches, that S. <hi>Aubin</hi> at preſent knew no more of him but the Name: But afterwards having recollected himſelf, he found his Deliverer was the ſame who had been his Ancient Contrade, and firſt Lover. He was ſo pleas'd to owe his life to this Illuſtrious Marqueſs, that he reſolv'd to ſtick to him, and forbear writing, to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Friends who had heard he was dead. The Marqueſs alſo remembring S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> had much of the Air of <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> and asking if he were not related to her, for fear of being diſcover'd, he confeſt he was his Brother. The Marqueſs imbrac'd him, and with a deep ſigh ſaid, he could never forget his Siſter, though ſhe had given him cauſe enough, in making the Letter he had written to her a Sacrifice to her Husband; and that he could never have reſolved with himſelf to love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, till he had heard of her Marriage.</p>
                  <p>The memory of <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> the merit of St. <hi>Aubin,</hi> and particularly his ſpeaking <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſo well, procur'd him every day new marks of the generoſity of the Marqueſs. The Generals ſoon after marched towards <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and the Marqueſs
<hi>D' Oſſeyra</hi> being in Love with the Counteſs of <hi>Benavidez,</hi> a young
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lady newly arriv'd with her Husband in <hi>Flanders,</hi>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:135663:34"/> went frequently to her Houſe, and would oblige her by bringing her a
<hi>French</hi> Gentleman who was excellent Company, and a great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue. The Counteſs, who ſeldom ſaw any <hi>French,</hi> was ſo pleas'd with the Novelty and handſom Meen of the Gentleman that ſhe received him very kindly; and having told him ſhe was extremely deſirous to learn a little <hi>French,</hi> and S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> having as frankly offer'd to teach it her, ſhe pray'd him to come to her every day at an hour. The Marqueſs making no doubt but S. <hi>Aubin</hi> might be very ſerviceable to him in his Amour, made him acquainted with it, and conjur'd him to do him this piece of ſervice with all the zeal and diligence in his power, in confidence he would be extremely ſenſible of the obligation. This was enough for S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> who beſides the tye of gratitude he was under, felt in himſelf a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent inclination to undertake for his Friend the moſt difficult Enterprize. In the mean time, he thought he had ſeen the Counteſs before; but not daring to truſt his Eyes, nor relye on her Teſtimony, he ask'd an old Chamber Maid if her Miſtreſs had ever been at <hi>Saragoſa:</hi> When ſhe anſwer'd the Counteſs was born there, and that ſhe was the Daughter of Don <hi>Franciſco Cortez,</hi> S. <hi>Aubin</hi> was convinc'd he was not miſtaken, when he took her for <hi>Zeraphine,</hi> his good Friend, and pretended Miſtreſs, in the Convent of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſuline</hi>'s. The Counteſs too, ſhe thought ſhe had ſeen a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that had the Air of that Gentleman, but not being ſure of it, she never ſpoke to him of it: Beſides, ſhe was ſo taken with him, she
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:135663:34"/> would have been troubled had she found out her miſtake. The Paſſion of the Marqueſs increaſed daily; it rejoyced his heart to ſee S. <hi>Aubin</hi> return'd to bring him News of his Scholar; and when he perceived him high in her favour, he declar'd to him the violence of his Paſſion, and intreated him to imploy for his advantage the Credit he had with her. St. <hi>Aubin,</hi> who was deadly afraid of the Progreſs of this Paſſion, did all he could to divert his Friend from it, giving him very clear Reaſons how improbable it was to gain the affections of a Lady, who had to her Husband ſo lovely and handſome a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as the Count <hi>Benavidez,</hi> and lov'd him intirely. But the difficulties he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to repreſent to the Marqueſs, proved but Oyl to his Flames, and St. <hi>Aubin</hi> could not avoid promiſing him all the ſervice that lay in his power: But the endeavours he us'd in favour of his Friend, produced a contrary effect; for the young Counteſs having ſtrong inclinations for St. <hi>Aubin,</hi> found her Paſſion increaſe by his frequent Viſits: This ſet her mind a roving, and ſhe took that pleaſure to look upon him as he taught her Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that ſhe was a whole Week learning the Verb <hi>Aimer, to Love.</hi> And making as if ſhe thought it a very pretty word, but hard to be remembred, ſhe ſpent ſeveral hours in making her Maſter repeat the firſt Perſon of it, <hi>I Love.</hi> She affected this repetition ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that St. <hi>Aubin</hi> believ'd she loved him in good earneſt, and reſolved to apply himſelf to pleaſe her, to prevent her anſwering
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:135663:35"/> the Paſſion of the Marqueſs; and incline him to quit it, by letting him ſee she could love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Fortune afforded him an occaſion, which contributed very much to heighten the Paſſion of the Counteſs, and the good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion she already had of her Maſter. One of the Counteſſes Women being grievouſly tormented with the Tooth-ach, and fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ſtrangers skilful in one Myſtery or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, applied her ſelf to St. <hi>Aubin,</hi> and with incredible confidence, and a moſt aſſured Faith, pray'd remedy from him. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently anſwer'd, he could infallibly cure her: And having touch'd the aking Tooth with his Fingers end, and ſaid two or three bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Words, whether this Maid was cur'd by conceit, or that her pain naturally ceaſed, she came to give him thanks for having wrought her Cure. The Counteſs wondring at the quick Effect of the remedy he had us'd, took that occaſion to commend him who had apply'd it, who having the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſuch conſiderable ſecrets concealed with ſo much modeſty. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of her Credulity, told her, he knew many ſecrets far more conſiderable; and that by looking on ones hand, be could tell all that should happen to that perſon: Women are naturally curious. This Lady adding im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience to her curioſity, pray'd him inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to look in her hand, and tell her what he knew by it. St. <hi>Aubin,</hi> without further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, fixt his eye upon it, and having long been this Ladies Confident in
<hi>Spain,</hi> and known her privat'ſt inclinations, he eaſily
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:135663:35"/> told her an infinite number of things that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd admirable to her, by his giving her an account of the particulars of ſeveral Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of her life; and above all, how she had been in danger of punishment for a Crime she had not committed, and of being buried alive as a Proſtitute Veſtal. The Counteſs was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriz'd at every word he ſaid; and when he had done ſpeaking, she confeſt all he had ſaid was very true. This was not ſufficient to ſatisfie her curioſity; she had no ſooner heard what was paſt, but she was willing to know what was to come, and conjur'd him with that earneſtneſs to tell her what should befal her, that he was obliged to promiſe the doing it another day, praying her to allow him a little time to think on't: But upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on she should keep it private without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a word of it, for he had no mind to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a man that medled in ſuch matters. Things being thus agreed, he preſently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, and shortly after went into the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſes Chamber, where he found him buſie writing a Letter to the Counteſs, which he pray'd St. <hi>Aubin</hi> to read, and tell him what he thought of it. It was in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> but ſo well expreſt, it is impoſſible to tranſlate it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſing much of the Beauty and Energy of the Original. Let it ſuffice, that we know 'twas well writ, and that the Marqueſs would have put it upon his Friend to deliver it. St. <hi>Aubin,</hi> though very loath to undertake it, could not refuſe him, but repreſented ſo dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly the inconveniences that would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his preſenting it, and made the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:135663:36"/> ſo ſenſible how fearful he was it would too much diſcover his being ingag'd in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and deprive him of the means to do him more conſiderable ſervices, that the Marqueſs was convinc'd, and found another expedient for conveying the Letter to his Miſtreſs, who thought the time long while St. <hi>Aubin</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not only for the pleaſure she took in his Company, but the paſſionate deſire she had to know her Fortune. St. <hi>Aubin</hi> came at the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual hour to teach her her Leſſon, but before she would fall to it, her Curioſity muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied St. <hi>Aubin</hi> was prepar'd what to ſay, and being concern'd, to divert her from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining kind thoughts for the Marqueſs, he reſolved to diſſwade her from loving him, upon pretence the Stars were againſt it: And having aſſured her of very high Fortune, and Honours proportionable, he told her the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets threatned her with a misfortune of being twice ſuſpected to hold ſcandalous Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and that the ſuſpicion would be ſo ſtrong, she should be in danger of her life, but that she ſhould at laſt appear Innocent, and more glorious for her ſufferings: But are you ſure ſays the Counteſs, I ſhall not loſe my life? Mine for yours, Madam, anſwers St.
<hi>Aubin;</hi> and I obſerve you have already eſcaped one of your dangers, and I ſee nothing can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb your happineſs but the like influence of your Planet that threatens you at preſent. This ſignifies, as the Rules of my Art tells me, that a Perſon of Quality of your Country shall be in Love with you, and do extraordinary things to pleaſe you, and make you ſenſible
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:135663:36"/> of his Paſſion; and if he prevails, you are to expect a long Train of misfortunes and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. The Counteſs judgings of what he ſaid should happen, by what she had heard him ſay of what was paſt, never doubted the truth of his Prediction, and reſolved never to Love <hi>Spaniard</hi> but her Husband. Two days after, the Marqueſs having ſound a means to have his Letter delivered, was not a little ſurprized to ſee she had ſent it back, without having read it, but expreſt great indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for his boldneſs. You cannot imagine how much the Marqueſs was troubled at the ill Fortune of his Letter; and not knowing what other comfort to have, went in ſearch of his Friend to make his complaint to him, and deſire his advice. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> glad at Heart for the good iſſue of the Game he had plaid, bid him not be diſcourag'd: And to let him ſee how much he was concern'd for him, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to make the Counteſs and him very good Friends again. The poor diſtreſſed Marqueſs was ſo pleas'd with the thoughts of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd Accommodation, that St. <hi>Aubin</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him went to the Counteſs, and prayed her to be reconcil'd, and receive him into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, aſſuring her, that the Billet she fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo Criminal, contained only four Verſes. 'Tis eaſie for thoſe who are beloved, to perſwade; the Counteſs, who had paſſionate kindneſs for St.
<hi>Aubin,</hi> granted his requeſt: And to give him a fresh inſtance of her Complaiſance, she promis'd to admit of his Friends Excuſes, as she very well might, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing really not much offended with him. The
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:135663:37"/> Marqueſs made ſeveral ſorry Excuſes, which paſt for good; but the diſorder he appear'd in, gave the Counteſs a clearer account of what was written in the Billet, than the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it would have done: And had ſhe not been too much poſſeſt with the fear of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin</hi>'s Predictions, ſhe had managed this Affair to better advantage: But her fear made her ſtand upon her Guard, and avoid all occaſions of being found alone with the Marqueſs, or giving him opportunity to acquaint her with his Paſſion. St. <hi>Aubin</hi> appear'd every day more lovely than other, and ſhe made diſcovery of ſo many good qualities in him, that ſhe could not forbear praiſing him in her Husbands preſence; who having obſerved the pleaſure his Wife took in ſpeaking of him, and ſometimes very little to the purpoſe, and oftner far than ſhe was aware of, he began to ſuſpect: And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving watch'd the Counteſs more narrowly, he found this ſtranger, under pretence of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Wife
<hi>French,</hi> was grown very fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with her. Jealouſie made the moſt Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Actions appear Criminal, and the Count reſolv'd to break off their Acquaintance: But having liv'd very lovingly with his Wife, he was unwilling to expreſs his Reſentments, but took a time to tell her, that though he had a good opinion of her Conduct, he feared the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ladies would not think well of it: And ſince she had a mind to learn <hi>French,</hi> 'twere better for her to take a <hi>French</hi> Woman into her Family. The Counteſs was extremely diſpleas'd at the advice, though she made as if ſhe approved it; but though ſhe promis'd
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:135663:37"/> to follow it, ſhe continued taking her Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from St. <hi>Aubin,</hi> telling the Count, 'twas only that ſhe might not forget what ſhe had learnt, while ſhe could provide her ſelf of a Maid. It went againſt the Heart of her to part with a Maſter that pleas'd her ſo well; and becauſe she was under a neceſſity to obey, she reſolved to make uſe of her time. As ſoon as St. <hi>Aubin</hi> return'd to her, she acquainted him with the Jealouſie of the Count her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and that she had never given him cauſe to ſuſpect her Conduct. Her duty, fortified by a ſtrong inclination for him, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made her abhor all unfaithfulneſs to him: Yet she never thought to have found her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions ſo ineffectual, but she ſaw her ſelf under the neceſſity of yielding to an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation involuntary and long check'd, but in vain. St. <hi>Aubin</hi> relying on the modeſty of the Lady, thought it the duty of a Civil Gentleman to take advantage of her diſorder, by preſſing her a little faintly: But he found her ſo unexpectedly coming and kind, that he ſmarted for the ſmall advances he made, and ſaw he muſt uſe clearer and more paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Expreſſions. And as the Lady unwilling her Compliance should be wholly uſeleſs, and thrown away upon him, reproached him with ingratitude for the favour she had shewed him. The Count having heard all behind a Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, came forth with his Poiniard in his hand to ſtab his Wife, if St.
<hi>Aubin</hi> with laying his hand on his Sword had not hindred him by a vigorous reſiſtance; and ſeeing the Count ready to go call in his Servants to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:135663:38"/> his Aid, choſe rather to hazard the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his Sex, than expoſe that unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Lady to ſo many inconveniences, and himſelf to ruin. He pray'd him (before he would make any more noiſe, or call in his People) to have the patience to hear him a moment: And to convince him he had ſomething conſiderable to ſay to him, he laid his Sword at his feet, and himſelf at his diſcretion. The Generous <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſeeing his Enemy diſarm'd, became more tractable, and permitted him to ſpeak. St. <hi>Aubin</hi> told him, it was for the Counteſſes Intereſt and his, the Count should be undeceiv'd, by the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of a ſecret he had reſolved to conceal all his Life. With that St. <hi>Aubin</hi> declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a Woman: and that in <hi>Spain</hi> under her true Name <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> she was intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with the Counteſs, and her very good Friend; that ſince that, a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſion for Arms had engaged her in the Kings ſervice in the Wars, which was ſo agreeable to her inclination, that she hop'd he was too Generous to diſcover the ſecret she acquainted him with, when she had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him the conſequence of it. The Count could hardly be ſatisfied with the bare words of <hi>Chriſtina;</hi> but his Lady up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hearing the ſtory, and Name of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina,</hi> having recovered her Spirits, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king advantage of her Husbands diſorder, perſwaded him she very well knew who <hi>Chriſtina</hi> was; and having reproached him for the ill Opinion he had of her Conduct, ſhe took her turn to run into paſſion; and her anger
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:135663:38"/> which her Husband thought real, and ſeveral other Circumſtances a great deal more true, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the relation of what paſs'd in the Convent, put an end to all his ſuſpicions. He beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g'd his Wives pardon, and thought, in favour of her chaſtity he remembr'd ſeveral particulars he had never heard of. He went out, to give them time to come to themſelves again, out of the fear he had put them in. The Counteſs being recovered of the fright ſhe had been in for her Gallant, and her ſelf, continued a while under a grievous Confuſion to find her ſelf decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: However she expreſt her ſelf very joyful to ſee her old Friend, but not without reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her; for that by concealing her Name, she had expos'd her to weakneſſes, no other in the World could have made her fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. St. <hi>Aubin</hi> was ſo perplext, he knew not what to anſwer. The Marqueſs, in the mean time, not able to Maſter his Paſſion for the Counteſs, whom he hop'd to work upon by his perſeverance, and the aſſiſtance of his Friend, had by his Liberalities gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one of her Women, who gave him an account of all that paſt in the Houſe: And having obſerved St. <hi>Aubin</hi> uſing his Miſtreſs with a familiarity unfit for any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, she thought it might be an acceptable ſervice to the Marqueſs, if she watch'd them more narrowly. St. <hi>Aubin</hi> coming one day to the Counteſſes before she was up, was ſent for into her Chamber, and made ſit on her Bed; and that they might diſcourſe more freely, the Counteſs bid her Maids quit the Room. This liberty, though ordinary in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:135663:39"/> 
                     <hi>France,</hi> appear'd to the Marqueſſes Penſioner ſo Criminal in a
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lady, that ſhe thought he would be very well pleas'd to know it, and went inſtantly to tell it him. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, no leſs Jealous than Amorous, was ſo ſurpriz'd at the ſtory, he was vext at the heart: and his Jealouſie perſwading him more than he had heard, he reſolved to be revenged upon his Trayterous Friend for all the ill uſage he had received from his Miſtreſs, not doubting but he had contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted a great deal to it. A ſecret inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he knew not the cauſe of, but attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the remains of Reſpect and Kindneſs he ſtill had for the Brother of a Perſon he had lov'd above any, render'd his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions uncertain and ineffectual. Yet cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to mind how he had oblig'd him, and made him his Confident, and that St. <hi>Aubin</hi> had upon his word engaged to do him the beſt ſervice he could with the Counteſs, he thought no Reſentment too ſevere for a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. But not finding in his heart to violate the Law of Nations, by taking a revenge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy his Quality and Honour, he reſolved to ſight him fairly, in hopes to diſarm him; and without further puniſhment, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him with his ingratitude. Having met him an hour after, he fell upon him briskly, without making any words. St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin</hi> defended himſelf, but as a Man who would only ward off the blows of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, without doing him hurt. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs making at him, with deſign to ſeize his Sword, dangerouſly wounded him. Upon that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:135663:39"/> they were parted, and the Count <hi>Benavidez</hi> coming in, order'd St.
<hi>Aubin</hi> to be carried home to his Houſe; and fearing his Wound more dangerous than it prov'd, he could not forbear ſending for the Marqueſs, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him the Name and Sex of the Perſon whoſe life he had indanger'd.</p>

                  <p>NEver was Man ſo aſtoniſhed as the Marqueſs <hi>d' Oſſeyra,</hi> when he found he had wounded his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs the ſame moment, and with the ſame Weapon he thought he had taken Revenge of his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val. The Count <hi>de Benavidez</hi> gave him an account of all that had happen'd, when he ſurpriz'd (the ſuppos'd) St. <hi>Aubin</hi> with his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and particularly of the diſcoveries he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied he had made of the Intelligence between them: The Relation was ſo ſurpriſing, and the Circumſtances ſo extraordinary, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs was ſo confounded, and under ſo ſtrong a Convulſion of different Paſſions, that what with fear, what with grief, he was Mute for ſome time, and appear'd like a Statue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Senſe or Motion: But the Paſſion he
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:135663:42"/> had had for <hi>Chriſtina</hi> prevailing over the reſt, and reproaching him ſecretly with having deſtroyed her, he prayed the Count to go inſtantly learn what news of her wound; the diſorder he was in, being ſo great, he had not the confidence to viſit her; but he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Count, though he ſcarce knew what he did. At the news of the Rencounter, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his Friends flock'd to the Marqueſs; ſome of the Commanders were ſo imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently officious, they would needs ſtop him from going any further, to ſave him the trouble of ſeeing his Enemy the ſecond time: But the return he made their miſtaken Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, was ſo unexpectedly untoward, his beſt Friends, not knowing the motions of his heart, were highly offended at it. They were all amazed to ſee him ſo troubled and not one could imagine what reaſon he ſhould have to go to the Count of <hi>Benavidez</hi>'s, where he knew they had carried his Enemy St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin.</hi> The Marqueſs was not inclin'd to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent courſes, yet they apprehended he might uſe his Authority to ruin the unfortunate Perſon that ſo publickly ingag'd him. A Colonel, his Friend was ſo officious, that to prevent a miſchief he dreaded ſo much, he met him by the way, and intreated him to go no further, aſſuring him St.
<hi>Aubin</hi> was ſo deſperately ill, he could not live an hour longer. This was the Critical moment the Marqueſs really needed the aſſiſtance of his Friends, and had they not hindred him, he had certainly ſtabb'd himſelf. The Count <hi>de Benavidez,</hi> mindfull of the diſorder he had
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:135663:42"/> left him in, returned as haſtily as he could to let him know St.
<hi>Aubin</hi>'s wound was not dangerous: But the Marqueſs, who began to relapſe into the extremity of his firſt Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> was ſo fully prepoſſeſt with the diſcourſe of the Colonel, that he thought the Count did out of kindneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the danger St. <hi>Aubin</hi> was in, and was loth to tell him News he knew would grieve him. This made the Marqueſs reſolve per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally to viſit St. <hi>Aubin</hi> in his Chamber; and he had certainly done it, had not the Count diverted him, by repreſenting the inconveniences might attend the ſurprize and diſcoveries their firſt Enterview would oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion before ſo many perſons who were of his Retinue, and then bore him Company. The Marqueſs yielded to the perſwaſions of his Friend, but not till the Chirurgeon had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him the wound he thought ſo dangerous would be cur'd in a ſhort time. The Marqueſs could not forbear telling the Chyrurg on his Life ſhould anſwer for St. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s; and ſwore to him, that if he died, he ſhould be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make ready to follow him preſently into another World. This being paſt, they brought the Marqueſs home, where he was viſited by all the Perſons of Quality in the Court at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> who complemented him for his pretended advantage: Some carried on the Complement ſo far, that they blamed him for the trouble he was in, having ſo great reaſon to be ſatisfied with the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage he had gained over one of the braveſt Men of <hi>France.</hi> He was ſo tir'd with theſe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:135663:43"/> troubleſome Civilities, that to be rid of them, he was forc'd to give order to his Porter to ſay, he was not to be ſpoke with. The Count <hi>de Benavidez</hi> loth to leave him under ſo much vexation, ſtaid with him, in hopes by his Company to eaſe him a little of the Tyranny of his Paſſions. As ſoon as they were alone, the Marqueſs conjur'd him, to tell him truly what he thought of <hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s Wound: The Count aſſur'd him it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſlight; and to pleaſure him, offer'd to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Chriſtina</hi> to receive his Viſit that night. This offer comforted the Marqueſs, and the Count had no ſooner made it, but he was forced to go home to find means to ſatisfie the impatience of his Friend. At his return he found his Wife was gone to <hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s Chamber, and he took the advantage of it to give her a Viſit: When he had expreſt the trouble he was under for her misfortune, he aſſured her the Marqueſs was almoſt diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at it, and begg'd her permiſſion to throw himſelf at her feet. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> thinking the Marqueſs ſtill took her for St.
<hi>Aubin,</hi> not knowing the Count had told him all, was extreamly ſurpriz'd at the News; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, ſhe paſſionately deſir'd to juſtifie her ſelf, and let the Marqueſs know ſhe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of betraying ſo generous a Friend who had ſo highly oblig'd her. The Count hailed away to carry his Friend the good News, and ſhortly after both entred the Chamber where <hi>Chriſtina</hi> lay, who taking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her to be St. <hi>Aubin,</hi> aſſur'd the Marqueſs he could never have been ſatisfied with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:135663:43"/> for being ſo unfortunate as to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliged him, had not the Counts Relation, and the generous Viſit he was pleas'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally to make him, given him reaſonable hopes he was ſatisfied of his Innocence. The kind Marqueſs, as if he had forgot
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> had ever been St. <hi>Aubin,</hi> anſwered in terms full of tranſport and tenderneſs, praying her to change her Language, and quite rid her ſelf of that unfortunate Name of St. <hi>Aubin,</hi> that had ſo unhappily occaſioned his miſtake, and ingag'd him blindly to attack a Life a thouſand times dearer to him than his own. He continued the diſcourſe with ſo much Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Kindneſs, that <hi>Chriſtina</hi> finding it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to keep him longer in Error, gave free vent to her tears, perhaps for Joy ſhe found him ſo conſtant: However, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended her ſelf angry with the Count for having broken his word in diſcovering her to the Marqueſs. The Marqueſs then telling her how much he long'd to know what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen her ſince ſhe left <hi>Spain,</hi> the Counteſs having obſerv'd how much he was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> ſaved her the trouble of the Relation, and gave the Marqueſs a compleat Relation of all the Adventures <hi>Chriſtina</hi> had acquainted her with. The loving Marqueſs who thought all along <hi>Chriſtina</hi> was Married, but hearing no ſuch matter in all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, was extremely impatient to know the truth of that particular. But the Count ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bethought himſelf that longer diſcourſe might incommode the Sick Party, told his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:135663:44"/> Friend of it, and prevail'd with him to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw.</p>
                  <p>The Marqueſs was ſo full of the Idea of <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> that he call'd to mind the ſmalleſt circumſtances of his firſt paſſion; and not able to comprehend how ſhe had left her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, his Love made him wiſh heartily he might find ſhe had not been Married. He could not give over muſing of his former Amour; at length he remembred, that the Perſon he had imploy'd to carry his Letter, and told him ſhe was Married, was a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant in a
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Regiment in Garriſon at <hi>Valenciennes:</hi> He preſently diſpatch'd a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger to bring him to him in all haſte: The Sergeant being arrived betimes the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Marqueſs locked him up with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his Chamber, and with horrible threats charged him to declare truly why he had deceived him, and what reaſon he had to tell him his Miſtreſs was Married, whereas he was newly informed by a <hi>French</hi> Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſhe never had been ſo. The Man was ſo aſtoniſh'd at the Marqueſſes Mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and betray'd by his own Conſcience, that he ſtood for a while mute as a Fiſh: But being preſs'd to tell the Truth, he fell at his feet, and confeſt he had been forced by the Marchioneſs his Mother to tell him that Lye. The Marqueſs not deſiring to know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, ſent back the Sergeant; and not doubting but <hi>Chriſtina</hi> had been always faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him, he reſolved to love her as long as he liv'd. A Servant he had ſent to enquire
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:135663:44"/> of her health, brought him word ſhe was much better: With that he went preſently to her, and entred her Chamber the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they were going to blood her: But the Chyrurgion remembring how terribly the Marqueſs had threatned him the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was ſo diſorder'd at the ſight of him, that he miſs'd the Vein twice; ſo that they were forc'd to pray the Marqueſs to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, and ſent for another Chirurgeon, who had a better heart, and did the buſineſs. As great care as was taken to conceal <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s Sex, her Combat with the Marqueſs was become the Diſcourſe of the Town, and the noiſe of her Adventures had inſpir'd into all a curioſity about her: Every one ſpoke of her according to his Humour: The Publick is never ſatisfied with the bare truth of things, and you may believe ſo many circumſtances added to the diſadvantage of the Counteſs in the ſtory of
<hi>Chriſtina,</hi> that coming to her Husband's Ear, he could not forbear expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to her his Reſentment, and in very harſh terms. The Counteſs having already enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a ſecret Jealouſie againſt <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> and perceiving her ſelf the Cully of all this Intrigue, was vext at the heart to ſee her ſelf robb'd of her Gallant, and at the ſame time in diſguſt with her Husband. This made her reſolve to endeavour making ſure of the Marqueſs, being ſatisfied, that Guilty or Innocent, ſhe ſhould be equally o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to her Husband, having the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be already ſuſpected by him. The deſign was ſcarce fram'd into her mind, but
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:135663:45"/> the Marqueſs entred her Chamber, intreating her, that ſince he could not with decency viſit <hi>Chriſtina</hi> alone any longer, ſhe would favour him with her Company to <hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s Chamber. The Counteſs received him with more kindneſs than ordinary; and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs ſenſible what advantage it might be to him to have her his Friend to do Him good Offices with <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> laid hold on the occaſion, and anſwer'd her Civility ſo very obligingly, it gave her great ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as <hi>Chriſtina</hi> began to be ſomewhat better, ſhe was viſited by all the Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the Court at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> Curioſity moving ſeveral to ſee her, who had no other reaſon to perform that reſpect. Her illneſs made her look much thinner than ordinary, but her Complexion had mended upon't, her long lying a bed having recovered the delicate white and red of her face, which the ſervice of War had miſerably tann'd. She appear'd very charming in very plain habit; and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Court expreſt ſo much eſteem for her, that it contributed very much to her cure. It may be ſaid to the praiſe of the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gentry, that they are the greateſt Gallants of any in <hi>Europe;</hi> and in menage of Intrigues, and carrying on the ſubtilties of neat and delicate Gallantry, exceed the
<hi>French,</hi> who value themſelves ſo much upon it. They have the Sex in ſo great Veneration, that to praiſe their Miſtreſſes, they ſeldom ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to run into profaneneſs: So that it will not appear ſtrange, that the miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Perſon beautiful as <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:135663:45"/> to her Bed upon an occaſion ſo unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual with thoſe of her Sex, moved all thoſe who viſited her, to pity her extreamly.</p>
                  <p>But the Count <hi>de Salazar,</hi> Governour of the Cittadel at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> had ſcarcely ſeen her, but he fell deſperately in Love with her. This Gentleman was a near Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Counteſs <hi>de Benavidez,</hi> which gave him the advantage of viſiting her oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than others. His Love tormented him, yet he durſt not complain of it, either fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it might be in vain, or finding no ſmall reluctancy in himſelf to act ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful a part againſt the Marqueſs <hi>d' Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeyra</hi> his Friend. Love obſerves no mean, when fixt on extraordinary perſons; and every Viſit the Count made <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> he found his Paſſion increaſe. At laſt it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo violent, he could not maſter it: He thought it high time to make his Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and reſolved twenty times to tell her how much he lov'd her, and twenty times fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the confidence to do it. After all, he reſolved to make his Kinſwoman his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident; and having acquainted her with the vehemence of his Paſſion, the Counteſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending her ſelf very much concerned for him, promis'd to ſerve him; tho' in truth the principal motive that engag'd her in that affair, was her particular intereſt to rob
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> of the Marqueſs, and at the ſame time to revenge her ſelf of her Husband for his Jealouſie. <hi>Salazar,</hi> aſſur'd of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Counteſs, viſited
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:135663:46"/> frequently, who as courteouſly received him, as introduced into her Acquaintance by the Marqueſs. <hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s Civility made <hi>Salazar</hi> believe the Counteſs had ſpoken to <hi>Chriſtina</hi> in his favour. Being full of this Opinion, he ſpoke to her with that liberty he durſt not otherwiſe have done. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> perceiving by <hi>Salazar</hi>'s diſcourſe he was more concerned for her Recovery than might be expected meerly from his Friendſhip for the Marqueſs, made as if ſhe underſtood not his meaning; and to prevent the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a breach with him, anſwer'd in Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery his obliging expreſſions. <hi>Salazar</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded himſelf for the good ſucceſs of his firſt attempt: This confirm'd his Paſſion, and made him forget the reſpects he ſhould have retained for his Friend. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs <hi>de Benavidez</hi> omitted nothing the while to rekindle the Marqueſs's flame: But find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her endeavours vain to recover for her ſelf the affection of a heart which had newly ſubmitted it ſelf to the violence of its firſt impreſſions, which are ever the ſtrongeſt, ſhe bethought her ſelf of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, which (ſhe doubted not) would make her Miſtreſs of her deſign; and the better to deceive
<hi>Chriſtina,</hi> pretending her ſelf very much her Friend, ſhe told her, by way of confidence, ſhe had newly learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſecret <hi>Chriſtina</hi> was very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to know. When ſhe had made all the Preambles uſual to ſmooth the way for a piece of ill news, ſhe fell to aggravating
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:135663:46"/> the unhappineſs of Woman that truſt the Oaths of Men who make Love to them, when after her ſignal fidelity to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>d' Oſſeyra,</hi> he was ſtill in doubt of her, and ſet on his Friend <hi>Salazar</hi> to try her, by pretending to Love her: That the conduct of the Marqueſs in this particular appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo criminal, when he had ſo great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to reſt aſſur'd of her fidelity, that ſhe thought it her duty to make her acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it as ſoon as her Kinſman <hi>Salazar</hi> had told her of it.
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> calling to mind <hi>Salazar</hi>'s diſcourſe, thought the intelligence the Counteſs had given her, of very great importance, and no leſs ſincerity; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving expreſt no ſmall reſentment againſt the Marqueſs, ſhe thanked the Counteſs, and aſſured her ſhe would take her advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of the advice ſhe had given her, and would make that fickle headed Lover know the intereſt he had in her was not ſo well grounded, but a proceeding ſo unhandſome and diſobliging as this might utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it. The Counteſs joyful to ſee her Intrigue take ſo well, and making no doubt but <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> to be revenged of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, would uſe <hi>Salazar</hi> well, made him ſenſible what good ſervice ſhe had done him, and told him he might declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf freely, and never fear the ſucceſs. This made him wait on <hi>Chriſtina</hi> the oftner, and take his opportunity to make a formal Declaration of his Paſſion. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Complement ſo gently and quietly,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:135663:47"/> that <hi>Salazar</hi> flattered himſelf ſhe was in Love with him. The Marqueſs obſerving how conſtant and diligent his friend <hi>Salazar</hi> was in viſiting his Miſtreſs, began to apprehend he might be his Rival. And ſhe us'd him with that kindneſs in the Marqueſſes preſence, it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diſtracted him. He made his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of it to
<hi>Chriſtina,</hi> but ſhe made ſo light of all he ſaid, it vext him at the heart. The Counteſs watching all opportunities, took her advantages of th ſe favourable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, to invite the Marqueſs more than ever: But all to no purpoſe; this threw her into abſolute deſpair, and made her to reſolve to ſatisfie her Revenge if ſhe could not her Love. A Woman in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will ſacrifice any thing to her reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the Counteſs had recourſe to new Artifices to provoke <hi>Chriſtina</hi> againſt the Marqueſs, and him againſt <hi>Salazar:</hi> They were all ſo diſpos'd for her purpoſe, ſhe eaſily accompliſh'd her deſign. The Marqueſs and <hi>Salazar</hi> were at very high words; and the Governour of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi> being inform'd of it, ordered them both to be ſecured. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> having newly recovered her health, was ſo troubled ſhe had been the cauſe of ſo much noiſe, ſhe reſolved to return into <hi>France,</hi> and ſpend her. Life in a Convent, and be no longer the May game of Love, and of Fortune. She imparted her reſolution to the Counteſs, who ſeeming to diſapprove it, offer'd ſome
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:135663:47"/> weak reaſons to divert her from the deſign, though in truth ſhe was glad at heart ſhe had taken that reſolution, in hopes to ſee ſo dangerous a Rival at further diſtance, which <hi>Chriſtina</hi> might have eaſily perceived, had ſhe not been poſſeſt to Blindneſs with the Opinion of ſincere kindneſs ſhe thought the Counteſs had for her.</p>
                  <p>The Dutcheſs of <hi>Arſchott</hi> having about that time obtain'd a Paſs-port from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of <hi>France</hi> to go from <hi>Mons</hi> to <hi>Lille,</hi> to ſettle ſome private affairs, paſs'd through <hi>Bruſſels. Chriſtina</hi> being in ſearch of means to execute her deſign, and looking upon this as a favourable occaſion for her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into
<hi>France</hi> under the Paſs-port of the Dutcheſs, communicated her thoughts to the Counteſs, who ſeeing her reſolved, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitated all things for her private retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Marqueſs might know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it. She preſented her to the Dutcheſs, and ſaid in her favour whatever ſhe thought neceſſary to perſwade the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs to take her along. The Dutcheſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her very obligingly, and declared her ſelf very glad of the company of ſo lovely a Perſon. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> left <hi>Bruſſels</hi> abundantly ſatisfi'd, at leaſt in appearance, to have the opportunity of returning to her Country, yet not without a ſecret reluctance to be at ſo great a diſtance from the Marqueſs, for whom ſhe had more kindneſs than ſhe was aware of. The Amorous Marqueſs
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:135663:48"/> fail'd not a day to ſend to the Counteſs to inquire of his Miſtreſs: The Counteſs fearing he might have News of her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture timely enough to ſtay her, took care to tell thoſe who were going from the Marqueſs to her Lodging, that ſhe went to Bed very late the night before, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired not to be awaked. The ſecond day the Counteſs laid her ſelf in the Bed <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina</hi> uſually lay in, and counterfeiting her voice, anſwer'd the Perſon the Marqueſs had ſent to inquire of her health, that ſhe was much obliged to his maſter, for his care of her. The Counteſs had longer continued the cheat, had not one of her maids (who knew by experience the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs never fail'd to reward very liberally the ſmalleſt ſervices done him) given Intelligence of thoſe Paſſages; thoſe who have been in Love can eaſily imagine the effects this News had upon the Marqueſs: He would preſently have followed her, but that he continued under confinement: the thoughts of the ill condition he was in, inſpired into him a thouſand extravagant reſolutions, when he called to mind how he had loſt a Perſon whom he had ſo dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loved in the Flower of his Youth, and had luckily met with after ſo long ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by extraordinary Adventures, and had no ſooner diſcover'd her, but he yielded himſelf abſolutely at her diſpoſe. He ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined his Conduct in the affair, to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ery ſmalleſt Circumſtance, but could not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:135663:48"/> find any cauſe to charge himſelf with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving occaſioned ſo ſudden a departure: it was not in his power to gueſs the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it, tho' ſufficiently aſſured he was not the cauſe of it; but he looked upon her remove as fatal to him, who could not live ſeparated from her. Having tir'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with reflections, he thought he ſhould but labour in vain to retrieve her, who in all appearance was got already to <hi>Lille:</hi> Yet unwilling his paſſion ſhould juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him to have omitted any thing in his power for recovering
<hi>Chriſtina,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved at all advantures, to pray the Duke <hi>de Montalto,</hi> General of the Horſe, and his very good Friend, to ſend out a ſtrong Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty toward the way of
<hi>Lille,</hi> with ſtrict Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſtay all they met with, whether with Paſs-port, or without. The Orders were punctually executed, and the Party brought in ſeveral who Travelled with Paſs-ports, but no News of <hi>Chriſtina;</hi> and all this a-do ſerved only to make a great deal of diſorder, and give occaſion to the Rumor rais'd about that time, that the Duke <hi>de Villa Hermoſa</hi> had call'd in all his Paſs-ports.</p>
                  <p>The Marqueſs would not be diſcouraged for all this, but ſearching the means to have a Letter conveyed to her, he found a man who promis'd to follow her to her very home, rather than fail to bring him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her. The Marqueſs in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he was in, thought this ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:135663:49"/> and having loaded the man with his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, and filled him with hopes of more, he diſpatch'd him away with this Leter:

                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:135663:49"/>When the kind Marqueſs had written this Letter, he read it ſeveral times, and finding it very agreeable to his ſentiments, thought it long till 'twas deliver'd to his Miſtreſs: But fearing the Bearer might by the way be taken by ſome Party, he reſolved to ſend a ſecond with ſuch another Letter, in hopes that if one miſcarried, the other might paſs ſafe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Salazar</hi> was much troubled for <hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s departure, tho' the deſpair his Rival was in gave him ſome comfort: The paſſionate Love he had for her, and the opinion he flatter'd himſelf with, that ſhe hated him not, made him ſend after her a truſty Perſon, that upon his report he might the better take his meaſures for his future Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct: And not long after the Marqueſſes Friends, and his, reconcil'd the two Rivals, and <hi>Salazar</hi> received Order to repair to his Government.</p>
                  <p>The Counteſs the while triumph'd for the good ſucceſs of her Artifices; and the paſſion her deſire of revenge had given birth to, was grown up to that violence by the reſiſtance it found from the Marqueſs, and the advantages ſhe promis'd her ſelf by the remove of her Rival, it was not in her power to conceal her Joy and her Tranſport from the paſſionate Lover; who far from anſwering her hopes, loaded her with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches; letting her know, he was not ignorant what Tricks ſhe uſed to make his Miſtreſs fall out with him. This touched
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:135663:50"/> her to the quick, and put her into ſuch a confuſion, and ſo deſperate a fret, to ſee her Artifices diſcovered, ſhe took her Bed upon't that very day, and continued a long time very dangerouſly ill; the Phyſicians who attended her having never diſcover'd the cauſe of her diſtemper, but uſing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies for Diſeaſes ſhe never was troubled with.</p>
                  <p>While the Counteſs was in Cure, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Arſchott</hi> was at <hi>Lille,</hi> ſo well pleaſed with the agreeable Converſation of <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> that ſhe intreated her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, at leaſt for the time ſhe tarried at <hi>Lille. Chriſtina</hi> finding her ſelf ſtaid by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhe could not maſter, eaſily conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being glad of a pretence to continue a little longer in <hi>Flanders.</hi> He whom <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> had employ'd to inquire after her, had learnt ſhe was to ſpend ſome days at the Dutcheſs of
<hi>Arſchott</hi>'s; and as he returned to give <hi>Salazar</hi> that account, he met one of the Marqueſſes Meſſengers; and being a witty man, and well acquainted with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lazar</hi>'s ſecrets, he preſently ſuſpected the Meſſengers buſineſs, and examin'd him ſo cunningly, that at laſt he diſcover'd the occaſion of his Journey: And applying himſelf after to get out of his hands the Marqueſſes Letter, he ſet about him ſo dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly that, that he fingered the Letter, and carried it to <hi>Salazar,</hi> who received it with all the ſatisfaction imaginable. But the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſes other meſſenger more fortunate than

                  <p>The Marqueſs having received this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter two days after it was writ, was ſo well pleas'd with it, that he never inquir'd whether both his Letters were delivered. He kiſs'd
<hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s a thouſand times over; and impatiently longing to ſee her, he did nothing but think of the means how to do
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:135663:51"/> it: The enterprize was dangeroous, and he ſaw well enough what a hazard he ſhould run, to enter an Enemies Town, where the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance of the Governour juſtly height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his apprehenſion of being ſurpriz'd.</p>
                  <p>But Love, which never loves long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, eſpecially ſuch as tend to keep it at a diſtance from its object, quickly ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted an expedient the Marqueſs thought infallible. He procur'd from the Marſhal <hi>d' Humiers</hi> a Paſs-port for a Pedler of
<hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels</hi> to go Trade at <hi>Lille;</hi> and having got ſome <hi>Engliſh Point,</hi> the beſt he could meet with, he went for <hi>Lille,</hi> and eaſily got en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Arſchott</hi>'s, under pretence to ſell his Points; which were ſo fine, and ſo very cheap, he ſold many of them to the Dutcheſs, and her Women. At laſt he was brought into <hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, who very luckily was alone in her Chamber, perhaps to read over the Marqueſſes Letter.</p>
                  <p>The Love ſhe had for him preſerv'd the Idea of him ſo freſh in her mind, that diſguiz'd as he was, ſhe knew him at firſt ſight; and concealing her ſurprize, ſhe pray'd the Dutcheſſes Maid who had brought in the Pedler, to go call another Maid who had good skill in Points. By good fortune that Maid was abroad, and ſhe who had been to call her being withdrawn, the two Lovers having cleared all miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, and the Marqueſs having ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifi'd himſelf, they had the opportunity to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:135663:51"/> expreſs themſelves with all the freedom and tenderneſs imaginable.
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell'd with him for having expos'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſuch evident danger: The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs took that occaſion to tell her, that if ſhe were ſo much concern'd for his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as ſhe appear'd, ſhe might eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his expoſing himſelf for the future, by permitting him to take her back with him to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and marry her. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt with ſome trouble, ſhe could find in her heart to do it; yet found by her ſelf, it would be impoſſible for her to reſolve to be married to an Enemy of the Kings: What, interrupts the Marqueſs, would you have me then be a Traytor to my Prince, and my Country? I am not ſo unjuſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> nor can I think you capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſuch a thought, and ſhould eſteem you much leſs if you were: But there is hope the War will not laſt ever; and the ſcruples you make to be married to an Enemy of your Prince, I may very juſtly pretend to, would my Love give me leave: Do not you think we ſufficiently eſpouſe the Quarrel of our Soveraigns, by ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing every day our Lives and our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes to their Intereſt, without making our Love a part of the Sacrifice? But pray, let's have no more of theſe matters of State, but imploy better the moments of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation hath coſt me ſo dear. Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, coming in as he was ſpeaking, <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> was forced to diſmiſs the pretended Ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:135663:52"/> and appoint him to come two hours after to her, being unwilling to buy any thing till ſhe had firſt ſhewn it to one who had Judment in it. He went away diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed he was ſo unhappily interrupted. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> ſeeing it would be hard for her to have private diſcourſe with him, writ him a Billet which ſhe reſolved to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him ſecretly, to let him know her mind.</p>
                  <p>The ſuppos'd Pedler being return'd at the hour aſſigned, <hi>Chriſtina</hi> who was in the Dutcheſſes Chamber went to meet him at the Door, and told him aloud, ſhe had as much

The Marchioneſs <hi>de Bela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre,</hi> in her return from
<hi>Paris,</hi>) where ſhe had been caſt in her Suit) gave the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs a Viſit, and was extreamly ſurprized at the ſight of <hi>Chriſtina</hi> there, whom ſhe preſently knew for St. <hi>Aubin;</hi> and calling to mind the laſt years Carnaval, ſhe made no doubt but Love had a great ſhare in this new diſguize; and according to moſt Womens Humour, thinking it a mighty matter to penetrate the depth of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Intrigue, ſhe was ready to applaud her ſelf for the diſcovery ſhe had made; and to carry on her deſign, came fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the Dutcheſſes. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been very well acquainted with the Marchioneſs at
<hi>Paris,</hi> preſently knew her; and not able to forbear bluſhing as often as ſhe ſaw her, ſhe reſolved to take her time to ſpeak to her in private, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive her: But the Marchioneſs out of exceſs of diſcretion always avoided her; and perceiving it troubled
<hi>Chriſtina,</hi> ſhe came to her one day, and whiſper'd her in the Ear, <hi>Trouble not your ſelf, and never fear me, I can keep my Friend's counſel. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina</hi>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:135663:53"/> endeavour'd to diſabuſe her, but in vain. The Marchioneſs having a ſtrong fancy ſhe knew the Lady had engaged St. <hi>Aubin</hi> to put on this diſguize, tho' ſhe made a thouſand falſe gueſſes: for as ſoon as ſhe ſaw St. <hi>Aubin</hi> ſpeak to any Lady, immediately ſhe concluded ſhe was the Perſon.</p>
                  <p>After much labour in vain, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs obſervation, the Marchioneſs made the Baroneſs of St. <hi>Sauveur</hi> her Confident in the buſineſs, imparting to her the mighty myſtery; imagining St. <hi>Aubin</hi> not miſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Baroneſs, ſhe would not be ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in her preſence; and ſo ſhe might eaſily find out the truth of what ſhe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſir'd to know. The Baroneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a young Lady, and of a very jovial hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, was raviſhed with joy at the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of ſuch a Secret, and applying her ſelf to a buſineſs ſo ſuitable to her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, ſhe obſerved <hi>Chriſtina</hi> with a great deal of care, though little ſatisfaction. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred at her ill ſucceſs, and apprehending the Marchioneſs would impute it to want of Addreſs, ſhe doubled her diligence, and watch'd
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> more narrowly than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: But all this care and extremity of attention ſerved for no more, than to make her take better notice of the good meen of the pretended Gentleman. She thought him ſo amiable, and took ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in viewing him, that in a ſhort time ſhe found her Curioſity had produced an
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:135663:53"/> effect quite other than ſhe expected, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving inſenſibly engaged her in a paſſion for St. <hi>Aubin</hi> which was already ſo ſtrong, ſhe perceiv'd ſhe was not Miſtreſs of it. This made her long for an intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with ſo Charming a Perſon; and the better to obtain it, ſhe ſought for cccaſions of ſeeing and diſcourſing her; which was eaſie to find, all Perſons of Quality having free acceſs to the Dutcheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> ſatisfied the longing of the Baroneſs with ſo good a Grace ſhe was no leſs pleas'd with her Civility, than taken with her good Mein. She was a hundred times upon the point of telling her, ſhe knew the ſecret of her Sex; and that natural modeſty that ſticks ſo cloſe to Women well-born, made her as often change her reſolution, and quit her deſign. After many Conflicts in her heart, where Love, Modeſty, Freedom and Reſervedneſs ſtrove in vain to get the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one over the other, she found <hi>Chriſtina</hi> alone, and adventured to tell her, she had never known a Perſon ſo deſerving of Love as she was, and that had Heaven made her of a Sex different from hers, she should have found it very difficult to ſave her ſelf from paſſion for a Perſon ſo amiable. <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> who thought of nothing leſs than Love, thought this diſcourſe an effect of her Friendſhip; and anſwer'd she was extreamly obliged to her for her kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, aſſuring her, she would endeavour
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:135663:54"/> to return it her with all the tenderneſs of affection ſhe was capable of. The Baroneſs having already advanc'd ſo far, was not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd with ſo cold an anſwer: However, ſhe thought it neceſſary to appear content for the preſent, and to prevent the loſs of all, ſhe imbrac'd her tenderly, and gave her many thanks. The Dutcheſs coming in, and finding them in that poſture, ask'd the reaſon. The Baroneſs who thought her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces as criminal as <hi>Chriſtina</hi> believ'd them innocent, anſwer'd with ſome trouble (for a pretence to deceive the Dutcheſs) that ſhe was upon going, and could not take leave without imbracing her dear friend. What ſhe ſaid was believ'd, not one hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing percciv'd how heartily ſhe was vext to leave a Houſe where she ſo much lov'd to be.</p>
                  <p>Every time the Marchioneſs ſaw the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneſs <hi>de</hi> S. <hi>Sauveur,</hi> ſhe ask'd if ſhe had not found out the reaſons why S. <hi>Aubin</hi> had diſguiz'd himſelf: But having no account to ſatisfy her Curioſity, ſhe became more impatient, and reſolv'd to know it one way or other. Having mus'd a while, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to tell her (whom ſhe thought S.
<hi>Aubin</hi>) of the buſineſs, and to oblige him to impart to her the ſecret of his Love; and in caſe of refuſal, to threaten him ſhe would publiſh the ſecret of his Sex.
<hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina</hi> extremely ſurpriz'd with the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, would have undeceiv'd her, by making her a faithful Relation of her Adventures.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:135663:54"/> But the Marchioneſs prepoſſeſt with an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſhe ſpoke to S.
<hi>Aubin,</hi> gave no credit to the diſcourſe, telling him, ſhe would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him till that time to morrow to think on't, aſſuring him he might relie on her diſcretion; but if he delay'd any longer to acquaint her with the ſecret, ſhe would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſpoil all.
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> who conceal'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the Dutcheſs, gave her ah ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the perplexity ſhe was in, by the earneſt ſolicitations of the Marchioneſs. This was good ſport for them, and made them laugh heartily, and reſolve together, ſince the Marchioneſs was ſo abſolutely bent to be deceiv'd, and not be diſabus'd, they would for their divertiſement afford their help to deceive her: the ſole qneſtion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd was, what Lady ſhould be the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the pretended paſſion: Several were in nomination, but none ſo likely to take as the Baroneſs <hi>de</hi> S. <hi>Sauveur,</hi> being a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and jovial young Lady, and <hi>Chriſtina's</hi> intimate friend. The Marchioneſs being told of it, was ſurpriz'd at the news, but promis'd to keep his counſel, and expreſt great ſatisfaction at the confidence he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> by agreement with the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs affected thenceforward ſo much kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and care for the Baroneſs <hi>de</hi> S. <hi>Sauveur,</hi> and to appear ſo much concern'd for her, and ſtill long for her company, which the Baroneſs anſwer'd on her part with a great
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:135663:55"/> deal of pleaſure, that the Marchioneſs hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often obſerv'd them, was confirm'd in her Errour; and inwardly applauding her ſelf for having ſo luckily diſcover'd the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, would needs make the Baroneſs ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of it, that ſhe might know her ſelf at her mercy for the diſcovery. And not lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger able to keep a ſecret which was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy a burden to her, ſhe gave her a viſit; and having reproach'd her for not dealing clearly by her, in concealing her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of S. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s paſſion, In earneſt, ſays ſhe, by way of Railery, I was not ill prepar'd to penetrate S. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s concerns, and you have acted your part very well, only 'tis pity you had not to do with a Fool. All things ſeem'd to conſpire to deceive the Marchioneſs; for the Baroneſs bluſhing, made her think that change of her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance an effect of her confuſion at the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſhe had made. You do not deſerve, adds the Marchioneſs, I ſhould uſe ſo much diſcretion in your concern, who were ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to make me of your counſel: But fear me not, had I not promis'd S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> ſecreſie at his confeſſion, the reſpect I have for you would oblige me to ſilence. The Baroneſs ſurpriz'd at the diſcourſe, ſtood mute for ſome time, not knowing what to think on't: But as we eaſily believe what we paſſionately deſire, the Baroneſs no longer doubting but S. <hi>Aubin</hi> lov'd her, and that the Marchioneſs ſpoke in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, quickly paſt out of a great aſtoniſhment into a far greater joy: If a man will love
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:135663:55"/> one, ſays ſhe, how can we help it? Would you not think it hard to throw a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man into deſpair, who does things ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary for his Miſtreſs, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates by his actions the violence of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? I will pardon you, replies the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs, your want of confidence in me hitherto, upon condition you will hide no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from me for the future. It was agreed, and they parted both very well-pleas'd with their miſtakes; the Marchioneſs to ſee her ſelf the Confident in an Intrigue ſhe had ſo great a deſire to penetrate; the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneſs to be aſſured by ſo good a hand things that did ſo much flatter her paſſion. She was ſo fully perſwaded S. <hi>Aubin</hi> was in love with her, ſhe began to repent ſhe had been ſo forward to let him know the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhe had for him, fearing it might have leſſen'd the eſteem ſhe could wiſh he ſhould have for her This made her reſolve to force herſelf into more reſervedneſs, and be more ſhy for a while, to ſet an edge on his paſſion. It fell out as ſhe wiſhed; for <hi>Chriſtina</hi> to maintain throughout the part ſhe was to act for the Dutcheſs's divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; her own, was every day kinder than other to the Baroneſs, who through diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation (uſual with Women) receiving <hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s Courtſhip very coldly, hop'd by that means to heighten the Paſſion of her ſuppoſed Lover.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſtina</hi> not knowing the intention of the Baroneſs, nor the reaſons ſhe us'd her ſo, took
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:135663:56"/> ſo ill the flight return ſhe made of her Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities, that she for bore the continuance of them, and shunn'd her company, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent occaſions of diſcourſe with her. The Baroneſs perceiving it, could not brook this indifference above a day; the morrow she goes to <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> and in ſome heat ask'd her what she had done to be ſlighted ſo by her, and make her affect avoiding her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as she obſerv d she did. She let fall ſome, other haſty words, which ſurpriz'd <hi>Chriſtina</hi> extremely; who anſwer'd ſhe had never been wanting to the friendſhip ſhe had promis'd her; but that the Baroneſs had appear'd ſo cold the day before towards her, ſhe had no reaſon to wonder it had made her more ſhy. The Baroneſs was ſo impatient, ſhe would not allow her time to finiſh, but imbrac'd her inſtantly, and was upon the point of telling her, 'twas in vain to endeavour concealing his Sex from her, who know it already, by very good infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: But ſhe forbore, foreſeeing ſhe could not with decency take ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle liberties with S. <hi>Aubin</hi> diſcover'd ſhe us'd with <hi>Chriſtina</hi> diſguiz'd. Never did Woman love more to deceive her ſelf, and never was there love of ſo ſingular a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. Preſs'd by her Paſſion, ſhe gave S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> a thouſand occaſions to declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be what ſhe took him for: but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, all would not do, and attributing it to his fear, she ſtudied a thouſand expedients to accomplish as Adventure she could not
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:135663:56"/> endure should hang in ſuſpence. Time fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd her with an unexpected occaſion: Her Husband being gone one Evening for the Country, she ſat up very late at the Dutcheſſes, and having cunningly let fall a word, she would willingly lie there that night: She ask'd one of the Dutcheſſes Women if she would admit her her Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow: <hi>Chriſtina</hi> offer'd her a part of her Bed; the Baroneſs at firſt ſeem'd loth to accept of it, for fear of incommoding her, but at laſt she was perſwaded, the maid she had firſt ſpoken to having a Bedfellow al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, which the Baroneſs knew, though she pretended the contrary.</p>
                  <p>When they were juſt ready to go to Bed, the Baroneſs retaining ſome remains of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, was ſo troubled, and out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, she knew not what she did. But to give her dying Vertue ſome ſmall ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the diſorder her paſſion had brought her in, ſhe told
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> she would have only one corner of the bed, where she pray'd her to let her ſleep quietly without touching her all night. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> very readily promis'd what she deſir'd, and as readily perform'd it. When the Lights were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, the Baroneſs wha expected with impatience the darkneſs she long'd for, was aſtonisht to find
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> faſt aſleep. At firſt she thought it her own fault, and that her Gallant feign'd himſelf aſleep to expreſs his obedience to her; yet she knew not what to think on't. But having long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:135663:57"/> in vain to find him more confident ſhe ask'd him if he were aſleep: but receiv<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing no Anſwer, it almoſt put her beſide her ſelf. She fell a ſighing, but her ſighs as little affected <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> who was in a deep ſleep. The Baroneſs thought
20 times to awake her, but ſhame and vexation made her forbear. Never had Woman ſo bad a Night, though never Woman expected a better. At length it was day; and ſeeing her inſenſible Lover lie ſtill as a Stock, ſhe dreſs'd her ſelf haſtily; and the deſpair ſhe was in not permitting her to quit the Room without leaving behind her ſome mark of her reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe found Pen, Ink and Paper ready on the Table, and writ immediately this Billet:
<floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                        <body>
                           <p>
                              <hi>I</hi> Have receiv'd from you the moſt ſenſible outrage a Lady can ſuffer; but 'tis what I deſerv'd, having ſo blindly abandon'd my ſelf to a paſſion for a man who knew no better to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it. I muſt now endeavour to cover my ſhame: As for you, <hi>I</hi> adviſe you to continue the diſguize that becomes you ſo well. You have already the modeſty of the Sex whoſe habit you carry; and you are not to deſpair, but Heaven ſenſbile of its Errour in making you a Man, may take from you that little you have remaining of that Sex.</p>
                        </body>
                     </floatingText>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Baroneſs having written this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, laid it on <hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s Toilette, and withdrew. As ſoon as ſhe got home, she feign'd she had been all night up at Play;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:135663:57"/> and having had her ſelf undreſt, went pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to bed, which you may believe was not very eaſie to her. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> at getting up having found the Billet, dreſt her ſelf in all haſte to carry it to the Dutcheſs: it made them good ſport; and when they reflected on the courſe the Baroneſs had taken to get an intereſt in
<hi>Chriſtina,</hi> they concluded the Marchioneſs had impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſecret to her, and ſo involved her in the ſame Errour with her ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Dutcheſs was concern'd at it, and had the goodneſs to go to the Baroneſs to undeceive her; and having fully told her what she knew of the buſineſs, at laſt, tho' with difficulty, diſabus'd her. She would have gone thence to the Marchioneſs of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>llabre</hi> to do her the like g od office: but the Baroneſs ſufficiently confounded alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and fearing further explication might reflect more on her Credit, intreated the Dutcheſs to ſay no more of it but to leave the Marchioneſs to her miſtakes, as not daring to truſt her diſcretion in ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a point, where the matter appear'd ſo fit for mirth, and her Reputation was ſo deeply concern'd.</p>
                  <p>The Dutcheſs had now almoſt finish'd her buſineſs at <hi>Lille,</hi> and had written to
<hi>Bruſſels</hi> she would return thither ſpeedily, and hop'd to bring <hi>Chriſtina</hi> back again with her. The Counteſs <hi>de Benavidez,</hi> who was pretty well recovered, and had not loſt by her ſickneſs any part or her paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:135663:58"/> for the Marqueſs <hi>d' Oſſeyra,</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing talk of
<hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s return, was ſo frighted at the News, she made it her buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by all means to prevent it; and at length found an occaſion to have a Letter writ to the Dutcheſs of
<hi>Arſchott</hi> by a Lady, and one of her beſt Friends, to inform her she was with impatience expected at <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels;</hi> that her concerns being very dear to her, she thought fit to acquaint her there was great murmuring at Court that she had thoughts of bringing back
<hi>Chriſtina,</hi> who would not fail to give intelligence to the <hi>French</hi> of all she could learn at <hi>Bruſſels;</hi> at leaſt it would be believ'd ſo, <hi>Chriſtina</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already under ſuſpicion of Guilt in that particular. The Dutcheſs being highly concern'd to hold fair with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and fearing their jealouſie of her long ſtay at <hi>Liſle,</hi> eſpecially ſince the News ſpread in <hi>Flanders</hi> of her having had a hand in the Marriage of the Prince of <hi>Izinguien</hi> with the Daughter of the Marshal <hi>d' Humiers,</hi> look'd upon the advice as not to be ſlighted: And whatever kindneſs she had for <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> she could not find in her heart to expoſe her ſelf to mine for her ſake, in praying her to bear her company to <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> As they were alone one day, the Dutcheſs took her opportunity to make a long diſcourſe of the ſtate of her affairs, and the neceſſity she was under to avoid any thing that might give a jealouſie of her to the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards:</hi> adding, that this oblig'd her to be
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:135663:58"/> very cautious in her Conduct; and to deny her ſelf many things in themſelves very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to her. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> had too much Wit not to apprehend the meaning of this diſcourſe, and anſwer'd, she had for the ſame reaſons reſolv'd to return into <hi>France,</hi> as ſoon as she should receive Anſwer to a Letter she had writ into her Country; and in the mean time to put her ſelf into a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. They concluded their diſcourſe with mutual aſſurances of Eternal Friendship; and two days before the Dutcheſs left <hi>Liſle, Chriſtina</hi> entred the Covent of the Nuns of S. <hi>Thomas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Marqueſs <hi>d' Oſſeyra</hi> ſeeing the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs arriv'd at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> without <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> was very much alarm'd at it, and went in great haſte to inquire the news of her. When he heard she was gone into a Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, it extremely diſturb'd him, not knowing what reaſon she had for it: But the Counteſs <hi>de Benavidez</hi> watching all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to vex him, dextrouſly gave out that <hi>Chriſtina</hi> had long ſince privately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to her the diſguſt she had for the World, and the deſign she had eſpous'd to ſpend her days in a Religious Houſe. This coming to the Marqueſſes ear, the violence of his affection allow'd him ſo little time of conſideration, that he went away that Evening for
<hi>Liſle,</hi> with his former Paſs-port as a Pedler; and made ſuch haſte, that he would have been there timely the next day, had he not been
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:135663:59"/> unfortunately ſtaid by the way by Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who pretending themſelves Souldiers of the Garriſon of <hi>Ypres,</hi> got together to the number of ſeven, and robb'd Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers without any regard to their Paſs-ports. They led away the Marqueſs into a very thick Wood, where deceiv'd by his Habit and Paſs-ports, they took him for a Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and forc'd him to draw a Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change upon ſome of his Correſpondents, threatning to kill him if it were not paid at ſight; and that in the mean time he should ſtay with them for ſecurity. The Marqueſs was in no ſmall perplexity, not knowing who to draw the Bill on; and if he diſcover'd himſelf, they would certainly kill him, for fear of being punisht by him when once at liberty: what courſe ſoever he took, death ſeem d inevitable; but to gain time, he gave them a Bill upon an Inn-keeper at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> who had been his Servant, and knew his Character. When he had written it in the moſt preſſing terms for payment at ſight; they could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree which of them should be truſted with it for receiving ſo conſiderable a Sum: At laſt they pitch'd upon two of their Company whom they put moſt confidence in: The Marqueſs in the mean time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to inſinuate himſelf with the Robbers, letting them know he could ſcarce find in his heart to be angry with them, not doubting but that they had been reduc'd to that way of living through
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:135663:59"/> the avarice of their Officers, who perhaps defrauded them of the poor Pay their Prince allow'd them; and that he thought himſelf happy, in falling into their hands who us'd him ſo civilly, and were ſatisfied with a little Money. The deſire he had to ſee
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> made the Marqueſs deſcend into Complaiſances for ſaving his life, he had diſdain'd to ſtoop to on any other ſcore: Theſe were ſo agreeable to their humour, that he was preſently very fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with them, and they us'd him more kindly than at firſt, and made him ſup with them. The morrow betimes they ſent away one of their Comrades to buy in Proviſions; the Marqueſs ſeeing their number leſſen'd, and fearing the return of thoſe who were gone to receive the Money on his Bill, reſolv d to ſeize one of their Swords and die at leaſt with his Weapon in his hand. One of the four who ſtaid in the Wood, watch'd always while the other ſlept: The Marqueſs feigning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf very ſleepy, the Watchman obſerving it himſelf, went a little further into the Wood. The Marqueſs to loſe no time, inſtantly ſeized their Guns before any of them awak'd: but being too generous to kill men in their ſleep, he took out the priming out of two of the Guns, having the other two in readineſs to be diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Then went he to meet him who was gone into the Wood, and having threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to kill him if he made the leaſt reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:135663:60"/> he told him he was unwilling to take the advantage he had againſt him, and his Fellows, and was content they ſhould have the Money on the Bill of Exchange, but that for his ſafe paſſage through the Wood he muſt have his company a League fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, aſſuring him he would do him no harm. The Robber believing a Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man incapable of ſo bold a reſolution, and aſtoniſht to hear him ſpeak ſo ſtoutly, was forc'd to obey, and do whatever the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs commanded him. They were ſcarce got out of the Wood, but they were met by a Party of Horſe of the Garriſon of <hi>Liſle.</hi> The Marqueſs immediately preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Paſs-port, but having been taken with two Piſtols about him, and in a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter very ſuſpicious, they told him, he made uſe of his Paſs-ports to rob the more ſafely: The Marqueſs to clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, told them, he had been robb'd in that Wood, and related truly what had paſt, and how he had eſcap'd out of the Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers hands, which made the Troopers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to enter the Wood to ſeize upon the Thieves. But the Commander having be thought himſelf this diſcourſe might be a meer invention of the Marqueſſes, to draw them perhaps into ſome Ambuſh, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered only ten Horſemen to diſmount, and go into the quarter the Priſoner ſhould lead them, where they found the Rogues, and took them without reſiſtance. They were all brought to <hi>Liſle,</hi> and having confirm'd
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:135663:60"/> all the Marqueſs had ſaid, he had his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and no doubt made but he was, as he pretended, a Trades-man. What became of the Robbers, I know not, though like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were hang'd: But 'tis certain, the Marqueſs impatiently longing for news of <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> went ſtrait to the Covent where he had been told ſhe was. When he was come, they told him there was no ſpeaking with any of the Nuns, that day being ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide for receiving a
<hi>French</hi> Gentlewoman into the Habit.</p>
                  <p>The reports which had paſt of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s having taken that reſolution, and the Marqueſſes fears, made him believe it was ſhe. Confirm'd in this Opinion by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Love, he buſtled through the Croud, and without further inquiry, addreſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Prieſt ready to begin the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, and pray'd him to ſtay till he had ſpoke with the Abbeſs. Thoſe who obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd with what diſorder he pronounc'd h is words, were ſurpriz'd; and the Prieſt who had prepar'd an Elegant diſcourſe in praiſe of a Religious Life, was afraid, he ſhould be oblig'd to reſerve it for another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. The Marqueſs in the mean time was got to the Grate, and the Abbeſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, he told her he was come to acquaint, the Perſon ſhe intended to receive into the Number of her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters had promiſ'd him Marriage, and all the Vows ſhe should make would be null. The Abbeſs much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:135663:61"/> call'd the Maid to the Grate, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told her what the Marqueſs had ſaid, she charg'd her to declare the truth. The Young Maid, already ſufficiently perplex'd under the apprehenſion of that variety of Functions she was to undergo that day, thought the diſcourſe of the Abbeſs a piece of formality, uſually obſerv'd on ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the better to aſſure her ſelf of the willingneſs of thoſe who took the Habit; and turning toward the Siſter who had the care of her Education, she ask'd her very Innocently, what Anſwer to make. This, and the confuſion in the Marqueſſes countenance at the ſight of a Perſon he knew not, made all believe she was in good earneſt. And the people cry'd out the man was a Fool. The Marque's defended himſelf ſo ill, that the diſtraction of his looks, and his ſilence, made them abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude he was mad; and they drove him out of the Congregation, without his being able once to make his Complaint.</p>
                  <p>While his paſſion procur'd him all this ill uſage, his friends were extremely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for his perſon. The Inn-keeper at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> having been much preſt by the Thieves to pay his Correſpondents Bills of Exchange, knew the hand, and pretending he would pay them, went to the Marqueſſes quarters, and shew'd the Bill to one of his principal Servants, who confirm'd it was of his Maſters hand-writing, which made them believe he was in the Robbers hands:
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:135663:61"/> They apply'd themſelves to the Duke <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talto,</hi> whom they knew to be his very good friend; and having shew'd him the Bill, the Duke cauſed the two men, who demanded payment of it, to be preſently arreſted; and having ſeverely threatned them, they confeſs'd all. The Duke was in fear for the danger of his Friend, and went out in perſon in the Head of a Party of three hundred Horſe, and ſome Dragoons. When he came to the Wood where the two Robbers had left their Comrades, he plac'd Guards at all the Avenues, and went in himſelf at the Head of his Dragoons, and ſo croſs'd all the Woods, but found not one Perſon. This heighten'd his fear, and made him detach three ſeveral Parties, ſending them away into ſeveral quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to endeavour a diſcovery where theſe Rogues had their refuge, but all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; ſo that he was forc'd to return with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having any account of his Friend.</p>
                  <p>The morrow, a ſervant of the Marqueſſes impatient for news of him, and thinking he might find him at <hi>Liſle,</hi> put himſelf into Boors habit, and went in ſearch of him. As ſoon as he was arriv'd at <hi>Liſle,</hi> he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he had a Letter for
<hi>Chriſtina;</hi> and having got her call'd to the grate of the Covent she was in, he ask'd her privately what news of the Marqueſs. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> not able to give him any account of him, the Servant acquainted her with the departure of the Marqueſs from <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> the adventure of the Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, and all other circumſtances of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> who found in her heart a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:135663:62"/> ſtronger inclination for the Marqueſs than she thought she had, was ſo concern'd for his misfortune, that the trouble she was in at the news convinc'd her of the height of the paſſion she had for him. She earneſtly pray'd the Man to return inſtantly for
<hi>Bruſſels,</hi> not to omit any thing to learn ſome news of his Maſter, and to let her know without delay the ſucceſs of his care. Before ſhe could make an end of theſe few words, her tears betray'd the affection of her heart. When the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant was gone, she paſt ſome hours in thoſe inquietudes none can comprehend but thoſe only who have been in Love. The mean time the Marqueſſes Servant being an honeſt <hi>Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and very devout, deſpairing to find his Maſter, goes into a Church, and having hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily pray'd God to inſpire him where to meet with the Marqueſs, he no ſooner turn'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about toward the Church-door to go out, but he ſpy'd the Marqueſs ſtanding before him; and not able to contain himſelf; cry'd out at the Miracle. The Marqueſs alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſht at ſo unexpected an accident, had much ado to make his Man hold his peace; and giving out he was his Comrade, he told thoſe who came running in at the report of the Miracle, that the Man was a little crack'd, and had often ſuch Fits. They got off by this Artifice, and went into a houſe where the Marqueſs had lain. His Man gave him an account of what had paſt at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and of the diſorder <hi>Chriſtina</hi> was in at the news; the tears she shed, and the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition he left her in. The Marqueſs,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:135663:62"/> who after the laſt days work durſt not appear at the Covent-gate, was ravish'd with joy at the news of her being ſo concern'd for his misfortunes; and having got her call'd for by his Man, he ſlipt into the Speaking room, and quickly reviv'd her by his preſence. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was Converſation more tender than theirs; 'twas not in <hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s power to reproach her Lover with any thing the violence of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for her could not preſently juſtifie. She promis'd him once for all, never to be any mans but his, and pray'd him not to expoſe himſelf again to ſo many accidents, aſſuring him ſhe had already written into her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to deſire the Abbot <hi>Dizeſle,</hi> who had the management of her Affairs, to take a journey into <hi>Flanders</hi> to agree with him about her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. The Marqueſs well ſatisfied with theſe fair hopes, that ſhe might be at eaſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew ſooner than he would have done, and return'd to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> where his Friends by their joy to ſee him again, convinc'd him of the trouble they were in by the fears they had been under of having loſt him. To keep them in ignorance, leſt they ſhould diſcover the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of his abſence, he gave out he had loſt himſelf a Hunting, (a Sport he was known to uſe) and was taken by Robbers, who having detain'd him three days, ſet him at liberty. This paſt for current, being ſo very probable, only the Counteſs of <hi>Benavidez</hi> would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, her Jealouſie having given her a true gueſs at the cauſe of his abſence; it vex'd her to that height, ſhe preſently reſolv'd to leave no ſtone unturn'd to break the Correſpondence
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:135663:63"/> between the Marqueſs and <hi>Chriſtina.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About this time news came to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Troops were on their march: it was very early in the year, and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals were extremely alarm'd to hear of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the Field in <hi>January,</hi> in a very cold ſeaſon. All the conſiderable Officers came to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to aſſiſt the Governour of the
<hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi> with their counſel in a conjuncture of this importance. Count
<hi>Salazar</hi> being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd there one of the firſt, and having given the Counteſs of
<hi>Benavidez</hi> a Viſit, ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to revive his paſſion for
<hi>Chriſtina,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching him with his indifference, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting him the ſame time with the dangers his Rival had expos'd himſelf to for a ſight of her. <hi>Salazar,</hi> who had been diſcourag'd from ſeeing <hi>Chriſtina</hi> by the difficulties ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in the attempt, was ſomewhat asham'd; and to cover his coolneſs with a plauſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and let her ſee he had not been wanting to his Duty, he bethought himſelf of putting a Trick on his Kinſwoman, and perſuading her he was more in <hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s Books than she made account. The Counteſs anſwer'd, She could hardly believe it: He offer'd to make it out, and deſir'd only time to ſtep to his Quarters to do it. 'Twas not long e'er he return'd, and brought her a very paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Letter of the Marqueſſes to <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> being the ſame formerly ſpoken of which <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lazar's</hi> men cunningly got from the Marqueſſes. <hi>Salazar</hi> having in his hand a Letter which ſo clearly prov'd what he had ſaid, shewed it his Kinſwoman, and told her, she might judge
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:135663:63"/> by the Sacrifice <hi>Chriſtina</hi> had made him, how much he was in her favour. The Counteſs having read the Letter, was very well pleas'd, and thought it very proper and effectual for ſetting the Marqueſs and his Miſtreſs at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: She ſpoke
<hi>Salazar</hi> ſo fair, that ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with him to leave it in her cuſtody, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her promiſe to make no ill uſe of it; which ſhe kept ſo ill, that the very next mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment she went to one of her friends, a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Marqueſſes familiar acquaintance, and having aggravated the dangers the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs had expos'd himſelf to for ſeeing <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina,</hi> and the ill conſequence of his paſſion; it might be excus'd, adds she, did
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> but love him; which she is ſo far from, that she cannot endure him, but ſacrifices his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt affectionate Letters to <hi>Salazar,</hi> who to my knowledge hath ſeveral of them, though he hath the diſcretion not to shew them. To this she added many other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars which convinc'd the Lady, and made her believe she could not do the Marqueſs a better Office, than to cure him of his paſſion, and diſabuſe him as to his Opinion of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina.</hi> She fell to work on the morrow, and made uſe of all means the Counteſs had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd her with to perſwade the Lover to think no more of ſo faithleſs a Miſtreſs. The Marqueſs who could not imagine <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina</hi> capable of falshood to him, did not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily believe what was ſaid of her, and would not for a long time admit the ſuſpicions they endeavour'd to infuſe into him of her: But this Lady Preſſing him to it continually he
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:135663:64"/> promis'd at length to believe what she ſaid, if she would show him one Letter to convince him of the falshood of <hi>Chriſtina</hi> The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of
<hi>Benavidez</hi> inform'd of this good ſucceſs, ſent the Letter to her good Friend, who having shew'd it the Marqueſs it extremely diſturb'd him. He read it over and over, and knew it to be the ſame he had wit to <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> and she had ſent him an Anſwer of. He made no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger doubt but she had betray'd him, and his heart reproaching him for having been ſo long fool'd by ſo ingrateful a Wretch, he blindly reſolv'd to declare his reſentment, by writing her a Letter full of Scorn and Contempt, and in the moſt vilifying and bitter terms he could invent; which he did to this purpoſe.</p>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:135663:64"/> and the Letter was delivered her within two days after the writing it.
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> was ſo little acquainted with the language of it, she could hardly believe what she read: We are naturally inclin'd to be ignorant of what we wish should not be, and she would fain have been deceiv'd. But ſeeing the Letter unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionably of the Marqueſſes hand writing, and knowing the Bearer to be one he confided in, it offended her ſo highly, she thought it below her to juſtify her ſelf againſt an Accuſation ſo improbable and unworthy her Noble and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Soul: And laying aſide, on the ſudden, the gentleneſs and ſweetneſs of her Nature, she angrily told the man who waited her Anſwer, she would never take the pains to clear her ſelf to a man who thought her ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Falshood. And tearing the Letter in pieces in the preſence of him who deliver'd it, she threatned to have him apprehended for a Spy, if he went not away immediately, or ever ſaw her face more.</p>
                  <p>As haughty and couragious as ſhe appear'd before the Marqueſſes man, it was not in her power to over-rule the infirmity of her Sex, but ſhe burſt out into tears, and was torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a thouſand different thoughts. The deſpair she was in preſs'd her to take a courſe that ſhould remove her for ever far enough from the Marqueſs: yet a ſecret inclination (the cauſe whereof she knew not) render'd her reſolutions uncertain and ineffectual Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times she thought to return home, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſlik'd it, as having lately receiv'd a conſiderable ſupply of Money, and deſir'd her
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:135663:65"/> Friends Conſent to be married to the Marqueſs, which now could be of no other uſe to her, but to procure her the reproaches of a Province where people naturally love to talk of their Neighbours: A Religious Life pleas'd her as little, and after a thouſand Reflections, finding none ſo agreeable to her humour as the Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, she took a ſtrong reſolution to ſpend the reſt of her days in Arms.</p>
                  <p>While she was taking private order for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to another Town to put her ſelf in fit E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage for War, the Marqueſs (now his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was over) began to repent all he had done: And having conſider'd former paſſages, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to find his Miſtreſs leſs guilty, he bethought himſelf that the man who had one of his Letters to carry to <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> never came back again, but took Arms for the <hi>French.</hi> This made him believe he had ſold his Letter to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lazar,</hi> and deſerted the ſervice of his Prince, for fear of being punish'd. The quick return of him he had ſent to <hi>Liſle</hi> two days before, who brought him the news of <hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s indignation, and the Anſwer ſhe had made him, confirm'd his Opinion of the Innocence of his Miſtreſs. He was upon the point of going to caſt himſelf at her feet; but deſirous to know the manner how this Letter came into the hands of his Rival, he pray'd the Duke <hi>de Montalto</hi> (who was both their friend, and charged them never to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another) to go to <hi>Salazar,</hi> and intreat him to tell him upon the word of a Gentleman, how he came by that Letter; aſſuring the Duke however it had happen'd, he would not reſent it, provided he might know the truth, which
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:135663:65"/> for other reaſons he was concern'd to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Salazar</hi> being preſs'd by the Duke to give a poſitive anſwer, was highly diſpleas'd to find himſelf reduc'd to ſuch a ſtrait by the indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Counteſs; and after a weak denial, was at laſt oblig'd to confeſs to his Friend the truth of the buſineſs. The Marqueſs having made this diſcovery by the Duke, was ready to die for grief, for having upon ſo light grounds ſuſpected the fidelity of his Miſtreſs. This was not all his misfortune; for while he thought of going to ask her pardon, news came to
<hi>Bruſſels,</hi> that the Monarch of <hi>France</hi> was at the Gates of the ſtrong Tower of <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> which he beſieg'd in a ſeaſon when the Heroes of former Ages would have thought it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to have an Army in the Field: Wherein he ſurpaſs'd the Sun (which he hath taken for his Deviſe) ſince the Froſt and the Snow which hinder the appearance of that Luminary, could not retard for one day the courſe of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts.</p>
                  <p>The ſurpriſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were under at the news, was incredible. Every man had order to be in readineſs; and the Marqueſs <hi>d' Oſſeyra,</hi> Maſter of the Artillery, had his hands full; yet he was not ſo taken up with the buſineſs of his Charge, but he th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ught how to make his peace with his Miſtreſs. But how preſſing ſoever his paſſion was, his duty was more; and he found himſelf under the neceſſity of being content with writing her a Letter, which probably was very ſubmiſſive and kind: What it contain'd I cannot give you a certain account, <hi>Chriſtina</hi>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:135663:66"/> having never receiv'd it. This Illuſtrious He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roine, who had laid her deſign for ſerving in the Wars, and promis'd her ſelf never more to entertain any paſſion but for Honour, had left <hi>Liſle,</hi> and put her ſelf into Equipage, good or bad; and having joyn'd the King's Army, near <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> in a Troopers Habit, and under her former Name S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> he made his Court to the Marſhal of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly knew him; &amp; having pray'd to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſerve him in the quality of <hi>Ayd de Camp,</hi> the generous Marſhal having inclinations of kindneſs for thoſe who are handſom, eſpecially if perſons of Merit, granted his requeſt, and imploy'd him that very day to carry Orders into ſeveral Quarters of the Camp. <hi>Valencien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> which boaſted it ſelf to have been fatal to the <hi>French,</hi> willing to preſerve the reputation it had gain'd in the late Wars, made a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous defence. This happy beginning put the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in hopes the valour of the Inhabitants, aſſiſted with the rigor of the ſeaſon, would give them time to aſſemble their forces, and expect thoſe of their Confederates for raiſing the Siege. But the renowned Monarch who beſieg'd it, taking notice of this vigorous reſiſtance, and that they were provided to endure a Formal Siege, caus'd them to be attaqu'd a new way, which may ſerve for an example to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in future Ages. For having made a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment from his Army, thoſe brave Souls animated by the preſence and Orders of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſo much Superior to others, made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of all the Out-works, in open-day: Nor can it be ſaid it was by ſurprize, or
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:135663:66"/> without reſiſtance, eight hundred men having dy'd upon the ſpot, in an obſtinate defence of their ſeveral Poſts. The Kings Muſqueteers being foremoſt of the Aſſailants, entred the Town pell mell with thoſe that fled into it.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not undertake to write the Great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions done this Remarkable Expedition, I leave it to the Hiſtorians, whoſe buſineſs it is, and ſhall ſpeak only of what concerns my He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roine. This Generous Perſon was always near Monſieur <hi>de Luxembourg,</hi> who being upon the ſervice of the day, commanded that glorious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> ſeeing that Worthy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal carry his Orders in Perſon throughout, thought the aſſiſtance of an
<hi>Ayd de Camp</hi> very uſeleſs in ſo hot a ſervice, and having mingled himſelf among the Kings Muſqueteers, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Town with them, and ſhar'd in the glory of ſo hardy an Action. The Granadiers of the Kings Houſhold, and the Regiment of Guards following the next moment, the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon laid down their Arms, and the Squadron of Horſe who were drawn up in the Market-place were diſmounted. The Townſmen, who never expected an Aſſault of that nature, were ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd to ſee the <hi>French</hi> in the Town, that moſt of them retir'd into the Churches and Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to avoid the fury of the Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>While all was yet in Confuſion, ſome greedy Souldiers broke into the firſt Houſes they met with; and S. <hi>Aubin</hi> ſeeing no more Honour to be gain'd where there was no more reſiſtance, was marching out of the Town; and having by the way ſpy'd ſome Souldiers entring a Houſe, which probably belong'd to ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:135663:67"/> of Quality, his generoſity inſpir'd him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter among them, to prevent their pillaging it. He preſently met with a young Maid, very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, who all in tears threw her ſelf at his feet, praying him to ſave her Honour, and reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the many Goods he ſhould find in the Houſe, which ſhe wholly yielded up to him with all her heart. S.
<hi>Aubin</hi>'s heart melting at the diſorder and tears of the poor Maid, he put on a face of Authority, and made the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, partly by civility, partly by force, to get out of doors; and having lock'd them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd the Maid he would protect her, and ſtay by her as long as ſhould be neceſſary to ſave her from the inſolence of the Soldiers. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which in appearance ſhould have diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated her fears, ſerv'd only to heighten them: She could not imagine a man cover'd with blood, and with dirt ('twas not a ſeaſon for duſt) ſhould have ſo much Humanity, but fancy'd he ſav'd her from others, the better to play a Game for himſelf. Prepoſſeſt with theſe thoughts, she ſtood at a diſtance, and in a lamentable tone pray'd him not to leſſen the Greatneſs of the ſervice he had done her, by offering her vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to no purpoſe, being reſolved rather to loſe her life, than her honour: Fear nothing, ſaith S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> were you acquainted with me, and knew me better, you would have better thoughts of me: I ſtay here only to guard you, and will be gone as ſoon as you command me.</p>
                  <p>This Maids Mother was gone that morning to Maſs, and the Town was ſo ſuddenly taken, ſhe had not time to return home e're the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was done. The Father, who could not
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:135663:67"/> find in his heart to ſee his Houſe rifled, retir'd into the Covent of
<hi>Capucines,</hi> in company with ſeveral others who expected like uſage, as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well knowing the Rights Victory gives them who take a Town by Aſſault. But the Serene Monarch of
<hi>France,</hi> as full of Clemency as Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and willing the ſeaſon of the Siege, the taking of the Town, and the uſe of the Victory ſhould be equally extraordinary, ſent in Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Louvoy,</hi> who by mentioning the Kings Name, preſently ſtaid the fury of the Soldiers, and within a quarter of an hour caus'd better Orders to be obſerv'd in
<hi>Valenciennes</hi> taken by Aſſault, than had been obſerv'd by the Enemies at three days end in <hi>Treves,</hi> ſurrender'd by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. 'Tis eaſie to gueſs what a pleaſant ſurprize it was to the Inhabitants, when creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of their lurking holes, and places of refuge, inſtead of ſmoaking ruines thy expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to ſee, they found houſes very well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, and in the ſame condition they had left them; and inſtead of Fire and Sword they were ſo juſtly afraid of, they met with Officers coming into their houſes with Gold and Silver in their hands to pay for what they wanted. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> a while after looking out at a Window, ſaw all things quiet by the indefatigable cares of the Miniſter I have nam'd: And having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the Shops of that great City begin to o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pen, and that his fair Hoſteſs was now out of fear, he went out to ſeek his General, whom he found with his Majeſty, giving him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the particulars. The Parents of the Maid S. <hi>Aubin</hi> had ſo generouſly protected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing return'd home, raviſh'd to find their
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:135663:68"/> Daughter there, imbrac'd her with inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble joy. The firſt tranſports of this pleaſant Enterview being over, ſhe made them a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Relation of the Obligations ſhe had to the brave <hi>French-man</hi> who ſuccour'd her, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd the circumſtances of the ſervice he had done her ſo much to the life, and how free the Gentleman appear'd from Self-Intereſt, that her Father conceiving it not in his power ſufficiently to acknowledge ſo vertuous and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent an action, reſolv'd to clear himſelf from being lyable to an imputation of ingratitude and ſpent two whole days in ſearching (though in vain) for his Daughters Deliverer in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Camp. Having heard the Kings Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers had firſt enter'd the Town, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fanci'd the man he look'd for might be one of them. But having acquainted his Daughter with his thoughts, and told her the Muſqueteers were Red-coats, ſhe preſently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceiv'd him, by aſſuring him, her Protector was in a Habit of a different colour. Thoſe who are good natur'd, will eaſily gueſs what a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it was to thoſe grateful perſons not to find him they held themſelves ſo much oblig'd to: They were vext at the heart they could not have ſav'd their Goods without being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, and reſolved to make new ſearch for the man, when S. <hi>Aubin</hi> curious to know who she was, he had been ſo happy to ſave from the fury of the Souldiers, entered the Houſe by a Back-door, the very ſame he entred by at firſt.</p>
                  <p>He croſs'd a little Yard, and found himſelf juſt in the Room of a young Servant maid, who not fully recover'd of her frights the day before,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:135663:68"/> was ſo troubled to ſee a Stranger in her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that ſhe, ſet up her throat, and with the loudneſs of her cries drew all the Houſe to her. They had certainly taken him for a Robber, had not his good meen, and his Habit, which was very decent, made them think him no ſuch man. They look'd on him with aſtonishment, and knew not how to begin ſpeaking to him, till the Daughter of the Houſe came in after the reſt, and knowing S.
<hi>Aubin</hi>'s face, cry'd out, <hi>That ſame was her Guardian Angel,</hi> and ſtood at his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow in a tranſport of joy with the ingenuity and innocence of a true <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Girl. The Father and Mother as ſenſible as their Daughter of ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py a rencontre, ravish'd with joy to find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under thoſe ſtrong obligations to ſo love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Gentleman, imbrac'd him with that affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and kindneſs may better be underſtood than expreſt. The Father made him an offer of what part he pleas'd of his Goods, owning he held them of him, by whoſe bounty and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs alone they were ſtill his. The Mother, who had not yet ſpoke a word, interrupted her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, telling him, that in giving the Gentleman part of their Goods, they paid him only in part for the ſervice he had done them: But ſince he had preſerved
<hi>Mary-Anne</hi> their Daughter, dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to them than all the treaſures of the world, it was but reaſonable to recompence ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable a good Office to the full, by intreating him to marry her; adding, ſhe was their only Child, and that they had deny'd her to Wife to one of the beſt Gentlemen in their Country. The Father applauded his Wifes Propoſals, and
<hi>Mary-Anne</hi> gave conſent by her ſilence. S. <hi>Aubin</hi>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:135663:69"/> who was not altogether ſo haſty, anſwer'd their offers with a great deal of Civility, and gave them thanks for the Honour they would have done for him. The modeſty of his anſwer height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their kindneſs, and made them more eager, and put him to no ſmall trouble to reſiſt their preſſing ſolicitations.</p>
                  <p>After long diſcourſe, S. <hi>Aubin</hi> being call'd away by his Imployment, was going off with promiſe to ſee them again; but his intended Father-in-law looking upon him already as his Son, would not run the hazard of ſeeking him in vain, as he had done, over all the Army, but bore him company to his Quarters. By the way he gave him an account what a conſiderable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate he had, and forgot not to acquaint him with the Perſonal Merits of his Daughter, and the Quality of her Suitors. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> deſirous to put the thoughts of Marriage out of his head, took occaſion to tell him, it would be great wrong to the Fair <hi>Mary-Anne</hi> to be married to a Stranger, who had nothing to truſt to but his Sword, and muſt needs make her unhapqy, by being forc'd the morrow after his Marriage to follow the Camp, and leave her. The grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Father was ſo far from being diſcourag'd by theſe Reaſons, that having highly commended St.
<hi>Aubin</hi> for his modeſty, he imbrac'd him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and with wonderful frankneſs told him, he thought himſelf the happieſt man on Earth for having it in his power to contribute to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Fortune of a Gentleman of ſo ſingular Worth. With that they parted, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when return'd home, gave there an account of his diſcourſe with S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> magnifying the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:135663:69"/> good Fortune of his Daughter, now likely to be the Wife of a Gentleman, the handſomeſt, the leaſt huffiſh, and the beſt humour'd of any in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The mean time the Victorious Monarch ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given order for the reparations neceſſary for the ſafety of the place, decamped a few days after; and St. <hi>Aubin</hi> going to take leave of thoſe who had ſo much kindneſs for him, the whole Family was extremely ſurpriz'd to ſee him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on going. To be rid of them, he told them, he was under an indiſpenſable neceſſity to follow the Army the beginning of the Campagne, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of loſing the little Honour he had gain'd, and the eſteem of all that knew him; yet to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their importunities, he promis'd in ſome time to come and refreſh himſelf at their houſe for a month. The Mother taking notice he ſaid not a word of Marriage, ask'd him if he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to be their Son-in-law. S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thank'd them for the Honour they would have done him, repeated almoſt the very words he had ſaid to the Father on the like accaſion: But being deſir'd to ſpeak more poſitively, he anſwer'd in general terms, he had never yet thought of Marriage; that in truth he found himſelf very averſe from it, and would adviſe them to loſe no time for ſetling their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Parents offended at the Anſwer, thought he ſlighted their Daughter. S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> perceiv'd it, and knowing they were troubled at it, he took his occaſion to ſpeak of <hi>Mary-Anne</hi> with all imaginable eſteem and reſpect: But ſeeing they were not perſwaded his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was ſincere, he was at laſt forc'd, for
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:135663:70"/> their ſatisfaction, to make them a promiſe (which they deſir'd of him) that he would never marry any other Maid but <hi>Mary-Anne.</hi> The Father preſented him with a very fine Horſe, which he was oblig'd to accept, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void utterly diſguſting them: And having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his leave, after a thouſand imbraces, S. <hi>Aubin</hi> got again to the Army.</p>
                  <p>All <hi>Europe</hi> had their eyes fixt on the march of that victorious Army; ſome believ'd, that after an advantage which appear'd rather the work and fruit of an intire Campagne, than a Conqueſt of fifteen days, the King would have return'd to S. <hi>Germain</hi> to refreſh himſelf after ſo great Fatigues, eſpecially when his Majeſty had News from all parts of the motions of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to join his Troops with thoſe of the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> with deſign to oppoſe his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties undertakings. But that great Monarch not us'd to quit his delicious Palaces, to end a Campagne by the taking of one Town, how important ſoever, doubled the ſurprize and aſtoniſhment of the World, by pouring his Forces upon
<hi>Cambray,</hi> the ſame which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth had fortified with ſomuch care and expence, the laſt Age, to heighten the Trophies of that Great, that Wiſe and Generous King, though the Emperour, when he fortifi'd it, deſign'd it the Bull-wark of the
<hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and Cittadel of <hi>France,</hi> as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the late times called it.</p>
                  <p>While the greateſt part of <hi>Europe</hi> was diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently concern'd for ſo famous a Siege, S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin</hi> was buſie in the ſervice of his General with extraordinary aſſiduity and care, far beyond
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:135663:70"/> the uſual rate of <hi>Ayds de Camp,</hi> which the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>de Luxembourg</hi> ſo well approv'd of, that he choſe to imploy him before any other. The City of
<hi>Cambray</hi> being reduc'd to capitulate, the Governour, before he would retire into the Cittadel, deſir'd ſome favour (the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars I know not) in behalf of the Wives of the principal Officers. Monſieur <hi>de Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> being upon the ſervice of the day in the Trenches, and concern'd in that Negotiation, ſent S. <hi>Aubin</hi> to Complement the Ladies from him. He enter'd the City for that purpoſe; and having learnt that ſeveral of theſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were retir'd into a Monaſtery, he went thither; and ſeeing two or three amongſt them, to whom all the reſt paid extraordinary reſpect, he made up to them to ſpeak to them. He had ſcarce begun, but he perceiv'd he ſpoke to the Counteſs <hi>de Benavidez,</hi> who had follow'd her Husband to <hi>Cambray,</hi> where his Regiment was, S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> though ſurpriz'd at the ſight of her, endeavour'd to recover himſelf, and would have made an end of his Complement: But the Counteſs, who preſently knew him, would not give him time, but imbrac'd him with ſuch a tranſport, as ſcandaliz'd the Company, this Lady, who always lov'd S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> having then forgot her Jealouſie that made her hate <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> They ſpent ſome time in private diſcourſe; and S. <hi>Aubin</hi> having told her what great reaſon he had to complain of the Marqueſs de <hi>Oſſeyra,</hi> the Counteſs who had ſo great a hand in ſetting them at variance, was glad at the heart to hear the News, and pretending her ſelf much concern'd for her, pray'd her to ſhew her the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:135663:71"/> quarrelling Letter he had injuriouſly ſent her, S. <hi>Aubin</hi> having torn it, could not ſatisfie her deſire, but told her the ſubſtance of it, aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her it had occaſion'd her taking Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, with a reſolution not to entertain any paſſion but for Honour and Renown. The Counteſs would gladly have Continued this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, but fearing the Company would take it ill, ſhe put an end to it, telling them this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman having been Priſoner the laſt year at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> had done her the Honour to viſit her often. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> having confirm'd what the Counteſs had ſaid, retir'd, having offer'd them all the ſervice in his power to obtain the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour they deſir'd; which he perform'd ſo well, that the Ladies were ſatisfi'd, and gave him thanks by Letter.</p>
                  <p>The King deſirous his Subjects of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Boulonnois</hi> might be eas'd of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Incurſions of the Garriſon of S. <hi>Omer,</hi> and by his reducing that place might injoy the redreſs his Majeſty intended <hi>Picardy</hi> by the taking of <hi>Cambray,</hi> and the quiet all the reſt of the Provinces of his Realm are bleſt with in the heat of War, his Majeſty ordered a Body of an Army to be formed under the Command of his Worthy Brother for beſieging S. <hi>Omer,</hi> the ſame time he lay before <hi>Cambray.</hi> This Enterprize appear'd ſo great, that Strangers doubted the ſucceſs; and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who very well knew the ſtrength of thoſe places, and how well they were provided of neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for a long reſiſtance, made no great haſte at firſt to ſend their Succours: But frighten'd by the example of <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> they us'd extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:135663:71"/> diligence to join their Troops to thoſe of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in order to rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Siege of S. <hi>Omer.</hi> The King having notice of their motions, and forſeeing their deſign, made a Detachment out of his Army<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he ſent under the Command of Monſieur <hi>de Luxembourg,</hi> in aid of the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> before S.
<hi>Omer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While Monſieur <hi>de Luxembourg</hi> was condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting his Detachment with his uſual activity and vigilance, S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> who follow'd him ſtill, and animated by the happy ſucceſs of the Kings Arms, and the Marſhals Illuſtrious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, fortify'd his reſolution of continuing in Arms, had by his diligence ſo far gain'd the eſteem of his General, that he took particular notice of him, and imploy'd him on all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable occaſions. This drew on S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> the envy of his Comrades, particularly a young Gentleman, whoſe other good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties prevail with me to conceal his right Name, and to give him that of <hi>Richmond.</hi> This young Gentleman, jealous of the kind uſage S. <hi>Aubin</hi> receiv'd from the General Officers, and looking on him as an Upſtart, and a very raw Souldier, let fall on ſeveral occaſions ſome ſharp language againſt him. S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> who was naturally good humour'd, and had a very inſinuating way, perceiving his diſguſt, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to gain him by fair means, Courting him every day, and omitting nothing that might oblige him to anſwer his kindneſs by ſome evidence of affection. <hi>Richmond</hi> had the ill nature to attribute S.
<hi>Aubin's</hi> Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and obliging Carriage to his weakneſs,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:135663:72"/> and fear of quarrelling with him. This made him more inſolent, ſo that he purpoſely affronted him on ſeveral occaſions, reproaching him of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with his Womans Face, and telling him a Martial-ſoul ſeldom lodg'd in ſo delicate a boby. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> finding himſelf touch'd in ſo nice a point, could not forbear bluſhing at his reproaches; but willing to decline the noiſe of a quarrel, endeavour'd to put off all with a Jeſt, which did but incourage <hi>Richmond</hi> to be worſe than before. At laſt S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> urg'd by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent perſecutions, and ſenſible he could no longer conceal his reſentment, without expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf to continual affronts, he took his time to find him alone, and tell him he was a weary of his Raileries, nor would endure them any longer, but pray'd him, once for all, to put an end to them; other wiſe he ſhould be oblig'd to let him ſee, he knew how to revenge himſelf, though unacquainted with the ways of giving affronts. <hi>Richmond</hi> made ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this diſcourſe, but fell again to his old way of Jeering. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> met him one day on his march, and taking his Piſtol in his hand, told him, he was now reſolv'd to keep his word with him. <hi>Richmond</hi> having put himſelf in a poſture of defence, S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> diſcharging his Piſtol, wounded him in the arm he held his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol by
<hi>Richmond</hi> being diſabled, S. <hi>Aubin</hi> making uſe of his advantage, laid his other Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol to his breaſt, threatning to kill him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he would beg his life.
<hi>Richmond</hi> obſtinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſing, S. <hi>Aubin</hi> inſiſted on't no further, but told him, his obſtinancy ſhould not make him forget to be generous. Preſently after
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:135663:72"/> they were parted by ſome Horſemen that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took them. The Marſhal of
<hi>Luxembourg</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard of the Combat, caus'd them both to be arreſted; and having carefully inquir'd into the cauſe of the quarrel, he heard only in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> was the Aggreſſor. This ſurpriz'd him the more, as having ever known him of a ſweet and peaceable humour; which made him believe, he came not to theſe extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities without great provocation: So that he reſolv'd to know the bottom of the buſineſs, and found S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> had made uſe of all fair means in his power to win over his Adverſary (but all to no purpoſe) before he had ingag'd him. <hi>Richmond</hi> was blam'd for it, and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Luxembourg</hi> unwilling he ſhould ſerve any longer under him, ſent him to
<hi>Perron,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of having his wound cur'd, though 'twas very light. The Combat prov'd much to S. <hi>Aubins</hi> advantage, the General eſteeming him the better for't; and the other <hi>Ayds de Camp</hi> finding 'twas ill jeſting with him, forbore their Raileries.</p>
                  <p>Monſieur <hi>de Luxembourg</hi> was by this time ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd before S. <hi>Omer,</hi> juſt as
<hi>Monſieur</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to quit his Lines to go meet the Enemy, though far more numerous. The ſuccour came ſo ſeaſonably, that both Armies being ingag'd, and that of the Confederates were entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated: The particulars of the Battel have been already ſo faithfully and fully related, I ſhall not attempt writing what is better done to my hand by another; the very relations made of it by the Enemy, attribute all the advantage and glory of it to the Valiant <hi>Philip de France,</hi>
                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:135663:73"/> who was every where preſent; reviving their courage who began to give ground, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating the whole Army by his Example and Orders.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Aubin</hi> having ſtill had a longing deſire to ſee a Battel, was heartily glad of being at this; the ſeveral Orders he had from his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to carry through the Army, gave him the occaſion to ſatisfie himſelf to the full, and to be preſent where the Victory was moſt ſmartly diſputed. Happening to be at the defeat of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Battallion of Foot, out of his natutal abhorrence of bloudſhed, he ſav'd the lives of two Officers, under pretence of carrying them Priſoners to Monſieur <hi>de Luxembourg:</hi> And having as'd them ſeveral queſtions about the condition of their Army, and what Generals they had, he found the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> made a Body apart, under the Command of the Marqueſs <hi>de Oſſeyra.</hi> S. <hi>Aubin</hi> was ſo troubled at the Name, he ſtood mute for ſome time. He was think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at firſt to ſeek him out, and demand ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction with his Arms in his hand for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage he conceiv'd he had receiv'd from him; but he had ſcarce fram'd his deſign, but he felt his heart fail him, and more concern'd for the perſon of the Marqueſs than it could be for an Enemy. He did what he could to ſuppreſs and get rid of that unſeaſonable tenderneſs, but all would not do, his heart ſtill hankered after News of the Marqueſs, and was ſtrongly bent to ſave his life, if poſſible.</p>
                  <p>While St. <hi>Aubin</hi> continu'd under theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties, the King's Victorious Brother taking his advantage of the diſorder and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:135663:73"/> the Enemies were in, commanded Mounſieur <hi>de Luxembourg</hi> to purſue them with ſome Squadrons: And with admirable fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, his Royal Highneſs ſent other Troops to poſſeſs themſelves of the Poſts, by which the Enemies, though routed, might have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the relief of St. <hi>Omer.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Luxembourg</hi> the mean time being in purſuit of the Enemy, and perceiving the Dragoons (who ſhould have follow'd him) lag behind, and buſie themſelves in taking Priſoners, which would but hinder the ſervice of the day, he ſent S. <hi>Aubin</hi> with Orders for them to march, and to kill all their Priſoners. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried theſe Orders, but with ſome reluctance; yet knowing it his duty to obey, not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Orders of his General, he carried them with his ordinary diligence; and had no ſooner approach'd the Dragoons but he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd the Marqueſs <hi>de Oſſeyra</hi> among the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, which troubl'd him beyond expreſſion. The Officer who commanded the Dragoons, ſeeing an <hi>Ayd de Camp</hi> coming towards them a gallop, made no doubt but he brought or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and having advanced a little way to receive them, St. <hi>Aubin</hi> concealing to his power the ſurpriſe he was in, without loſs of time, he made uſe of that readineſs of wit incident to thoſe of the Sex, and told the Officer, that the Marſhal <hi>de Luxembourg</hi> demanded a Priſoner, nam'd the Marqueſs <hi>de Oſſeyra:</hi> As for the reſt, they ſhould be put to the Sword, and the Dragoons to march up to the Troops, in purſuit of the Enemy. The
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:135663:74"/> Order was preſently obey'd, and the Marqueſs conſign'd into the hands of S. <hi>Aubin</hi> whom he follow'd ſome paces on foot, not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend by what good fortune he had eſcap'd the fate of the reſt of the Priſoners. The Counteſs of
<hi>Bonavidez</hi> had told him <hi>Chriſtina</hi> was in the <hi>French</hi> Army, which made him reſolve, after the loſs of the Battel, to expoſe himſelf where he might be made Priſoner, in hopes by that means to have a ſight of his dear <hi>Heroine.</hi> The thought of this flatter'd him ſo pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he had not yet caſt his eyes on his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer, being over-joy'd with his having e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcap'd the danger be fear'd of dying with grief, for want of an opportunity to clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his Miſtreſs. This joy was but ſhort; for S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> to carry on his deſign to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, clapt a Piſtol to the Marqueſſes Breaſt, and bid him prepare for death. This troubled the Marqueſs more now than it would have done on another occaſion; and not able to Maſter his paſſion on the ſudden, he reproach'd S. <hi>Aubin</hi> with his cruelty, in making him languiſh ſo long, when he had reſolv'd to kill him. But reviving himſelf; I will die (ſays he) contentedly, if you will give me your word to look out in your Army a Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier who goes under the Name of S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> and tell him, the Merqueſs <hi>de Oſſeyra</hi> thought upon him to the laſt moment of his life, and had ſome pleaſure in his death, as having been oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd by the Love he had for him. He fixt his eye the while on him he ſpoke to, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to remember himſelf, when S. <hi>Aubin</hi> being on this occaſion more <hi>Chriſtina</hi> than S. <hi>Aubin,</hi>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:135663:74"/> and having had much ado to act this part with her Lover, diſmounted, and expreſt by her tears the paſſion of her heart, with greater E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence than the beſt Orator on Earth could have done it. The Marqueſs by this time knowing <hi>Chriſtina</hi> was his Deliverer, was ſo deeply affected with this new O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ligation, that he ſtood ſeiz'd with a pleaſant amazement at the goodneſs of his Miſtreſs, at a time when ſhe had ſo great reaſon to be angry with him. Yet as joyful as he was for having found her again in ſo extraordinary a manner, when he call'd to mind he had given her cauſe of offence, it almoſt diſtracted him; and not able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the miſery of that condition, he beg'd her pardon, in terms ſo ſubmiſſively paſſionate, that it was readily granted him, before expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation made of the myſtery of the Letter which had caus'd that diſorder.</p>
                  <p>They had ſcarce underſtood one another, but they found themſelves hemm'd in by a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe, which the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talto</hi> had ſent to reſcue his Friend out of the hands of the <hi>French.</hi> The Marqueſs was ſo full of Idea's of Love, and appear'd ſo little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for a liberty he was no longer Maſter of, that he was not yet ſenſible of his good fortune when the Duke of <hi>Montalto,</hi> who had given him up for dead, or a Priſoner, imbrac'd him with all the marks of joy, a true Friend could expreſs on ſuch an occaſion. The Duke ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him out of humour, and muſing, imputed it to the ill ſucceſs of their Enterpriſe, and thinking to comfort him ſaid, their loſs was not ſo great perhaps as they fear'd it on
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:135663:75"/> the ſudden, and aſſur'd him they had taken a conſiderable number of Priſoners. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, in the mean time, the Marqueſs had his eye fixt on S.
<hi>Aubin,</hi> Which oblig'd the Duke to adviſe him to ſend away that Priſoner with the reſt, and not trouble himſelf with taking charge of him. I owe my life and my my liberty, ſays the Marqueſs to his Generoſity; but theſe are the leaſt of my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to him, and the weakeſt reaſons I have to ſhare fortunes with him; and then judge you what reaſon I have to ſee him well us'd. This Diſcourſe awaken'd the curioſity of the Duke, and made him look more earneſtly than before on S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> whom after a ſhort view he knew to be the fair <hi>Chriſtina</hi> he had ſeen at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and was no ſtranger to her extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Adventures. He gave his Friend joy of his good fortune, and being well acquainted with the paſſion he had for her, he eaſily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd they had many things to ſay to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and diſcreetly retreated, on pretence of fetching up the Straglers of his Troops.</p>
                  <p>Though the day of the loſs of a Battel may be thought a time very improper for a General Officer to buſie himſelf with matters of Love, the Marqueſs could not forbear entring into a large diſcourſe, to clear all miſunderſtandings between him and his Miſtreſs. After a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand reciprocal aſſurances of loving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ever, <hi>Chriſtina</hi> repreſented to him the incoveniencies ſhe expos'd her ſelf to, by being diſcover'd by ſeveral Officers, as ſhe had been by the Duke <hi>de Montalto,</hi> and made him ſo ſenſible of the injury it would do them both,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:135663:75"/> and what a trouble it would be to her to be the ſubject of diſcourſe for a whole Army, that the Marqueſs perſwaded by ſo convincing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, conſented at laſt ſhe ſhould return to the <hi>French</hi> Camp, having faithfully promis'd him ſhe would preſently retire, to <hi>Paris</hi> quit an imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo unſuitable to her bex, and put her ſelf into a Covent till the end of the Campagne, and that ſhe would then marry him; it being her deſire to delay it ſo long, that ſhe might do it with more decency. The Marqueſs in Perſon guarded her as far as he could, and then orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Trumpet to bring her ſafe into the Camp. The General was in pain for S. <hi>Aubin</hi> when he arriv'd, and had ſent into ſeveral Quarters to inquire what was become of him: He told him, he had had the misfortune to be taken Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and that he was let go upon his Parol. Monſieur <hi>de Luxembourg</hi> believ'd him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to ſend the <hi>Spaniards</hi> a Priſoner in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</p>
                  <p>The morrow after the Battel, Mounſieur to make his Victory compleat, by taking S.
<hi>Omer,</hi> return'd to his Camp before the place, and preſs'd it ſo vigorouſly, that they were glade to Capitulate before he was Maſter of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſcarp: And S. <hi>Aubin</hi> had the pleaſure to be in imployment about his General, the day the place was ſurrendred, as he had been at the taking of <hi>Valenciennes</hi> and <hi>Cambray,</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Luxembourg</hi> having had the good Fortune to Command the ſervice of the day, when every of thoſe places was ſurrendred.</p>
                  <p>Three of the moſt conſiderable places of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> reduc'd under the Kings Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:135663:76"/> a great Battel won, wherein the Forces of two great Potentates were defeated; and all this in the height of Winter, and in leſs than ſix Weeks time, are Prodigies Poſterity will have ſcarce Faith to believe: Yet hardly any were ſurpriz'd at the News, though very ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing; all who had heard of the Kings Marching in <hi>February,</hi> having expectated Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions altogether extraordinary: And we may truly ſay of him, he hath taught the World not to be amaz'd at his extraordinary perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. His Enemies do him right in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. The Court of <hi>Spain</hi> was in ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation at the News, the wiſe Prince, who is Prime Miniſter there, having heard ſome Grandees ſpeak of it with ſurprize, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing the ſucceſs of the Kings Arms to his good Fortune, interrupted their diſcourſe, to tell them, his ſucceſs depended more on his Conduct and Merit, than on his good Fortune.</p>
                  <p>When S. <hi>Omer</hi>'s was taken, the King put his Troops into Quarters of Refreſhment, until the ordinary ſeaſon for drawing them into the Field: And moſt of the General Officers went to taſte the pleaſures of <hi>Paris.</hi> The Marſhal of <hi>Luxembourg</hi> being of the number, S. <hi>Aubin</hi> to perform the Promiſe made to the Marqueſs, would not loſe ſo favourable an occaſion of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying the Marſhal to <hi>Paris.</hi> He found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the way ingag'd in an Adventure extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, as thoſe he had formerly met with. The Duke of
<hi>Luxembourg</hi> and Count <hi>Louvigny</hi> go in to together for <hi>Paris,</hi> the Baron
<hi>d'Angoſſe,</hi> who has a dependance upon the Count, having in their March taken notice of S. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:135663:76"/> thought he had ſeen him, but could not remember the time, or the place: He took occaſion one day to tell him, he had ſeen him before. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> bluſhing at it, made <hi>d' An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſſe</hi> more inquiſitive. Having rack'd his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory a good while, he bethought himſelf at laſt this <hi>Ayd de Camp</hi> had the Ayr of a Man he had ſeen at Monſieur <hi>Strasburg</hi>'s at a Ball the year before, whom he had taken for
<hi>Madamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle de Meyrac:</hi> the only thing that puzl'd him was, that Man was a
<hi>Fleming,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Luxembourg</hi>'s People aſſur'd him, this was a
<hi>Frenchman,</hi> and had ſerv'd among the Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers. This put him upon a ſecond addreſs to S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> to pray him to tell him ſeriouſly, if he was not the ſame Perſon who was in Maids habit when he miſtook him for a Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Bearn.</hi> S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> perplex'd to find him ſo cloſely and buſily curious, thought it better confeſs he had been diſguiz'd in Maids Cloaths, than give him occcaſion to diſcover he had been diſguiz'd in Mans Apparel, <hi>d' Angoſſe</hi> having learnt what he ſo much long'd to know, told him, they might have very good ſport when they came to <hi>Paris;</hi> and that if he would but put on Womans Cloaths, he ſhould eaſily paſs for <hi>Madamoiſelle de Meyrac,</hi> by the help he would give him, to put a Trick on his Countrymen, which would be excellent divertiſement. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> promis'd him all he deſir'd; both ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at <hi>Paris</hi> extremely well ſatisfied, <hi>D' Angoſſe</hi> tickled with the Conceit of his Projects, and S. <hi>Aubin</hi> glad at heart to get rid of his Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities.</p>

                  <p>AS ſoon as S. <hi>Aubin</hi> was return'd to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> he thought of nothing more than to throw off a Diſguiſe had occaſion'd him ſo many troubleſom Adventures. He had a Deſign to reſume the Habit of his Sex; but finding himſelf engag'd in Buſineſs for ſettling his Affairs, which he might act with more Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Convenience in Man's Habit, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to reſpite for ſome time his putting on the Petticoat. The Morrow after his Arrival one brought him a Set of Ribbands, which did not pleaſe him, who had retain'd ſo much of the Humour of the Sex whoſe Habit he had put off, that he was very curious of his Dreſs, and went in Perſon to the Palace to make
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:135663:79"/> choice of Ribbands to his Mind. Having ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd his Curioſity, he retir'd in Company with a Man who quarter'd with him: As he paſs'd through the great Hall, the Bookſellers taking notice of his Souldier's Habit, thought he might have a Fancy for ſome Book treating of Matters of War, and ſhew'd him ſeveral, of which he made no Account: As he was ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting away to get rid of their Importunities, they told him, he muſt needs buy the
<hi>Heroine Muſqueteer:</hi> The Title was ſo extraordinary, it awaken'd his Curioſity, that he went to a Shop, and taking the Book in his Hand, open'd it with that haſte, they might eaſily ſee, by his Eagerneſs, the impatient Deſire he had to read it: Having run over the firſt Leaf, and found it was the Story of his Life, he bluſh'd: When he came to the Relation of his Brother's Death, he turn'd pale; and all the Wit he had was little enough to conceal the Aſtoniſhment he was under upon reading a Paſſage he was ſo much concern'd in. His Companion obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him change Colour, thought him not well, and entreated him to go to his Quarters, and let alone thoſe Books, which he might better ſee another time. But S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> was ſo buſie a reading, that he minded not his Companion, but read on with incredible eagerneſs. His Companion obſerving him ſo intent on the Book, ſnatch'd it out of his Hand, and told him it was Dinner-time. Being much preſs'd by his Friend, he conceal'd his Surprize, and went along with him, having firſt bought the <hi>Heroine Muſqueteer,</hi> and ſome other Books,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:135663:79"/> which he took not out of any mind he had to read them, but to prevent being ſuſpected for the concern he appear'd in for the <hi>Heroine Muſqueteer,</hi> had he bought it alone. When they came to their Lodging there was very good company; but S. <hi>Aubin</hi> impatient to read out his Story, withdrew into a Corner of the Hall, to go on with the Book while the Meat was ſerv'd in, and was hardly perſwaded to give over till after Dinner. His Companion taking notice of his earneſtneſs and haſte to read over this Book, took occaſion to railly him for his Curioſity. An Abbot who was in company, mingled in diſcourse with them. Having ſpent much time at <hi>Paris</hi> (where he wore a ſtarch'd Band, which he took more care to change than his ſorry diſcourſe) he had the arrogance to take upon him to decide and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure all matters whatever; and told S. <hi>Aubin</hi> he was to blame for being ſo much taken with the reading of that Book, being but the Relation of a rambling Wench, whom the Author had transform'd into a Heroine. A young Marqueſs who lodg'd in the Houſe, interrupting the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, ſaid he was much ſurpriz'd at his diſcourſe; a Muſqueteer his Kinſman, having aſſur'd him he knew the Maid, and had been an Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her brave actions: The reſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany took part with the Marqueſs, and the Abbot who lov'd not to be contradicted, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained what he had ſaid with more obſtinacy than reaſon. They came to high words on both ſides, and the Marqueſs had almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got all reſpect to the Abbot. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> was
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:135663:80"/> the only Perſon had not declar'd himſelf, and though glad at the heart to ſee the Abbot worſted, he thought himſelf oblig'd to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reconcile them, ſince he had occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the quarrel. He intreated them all not to be ſo much concern'd for a thing they were not aſſur'd of; adding, he had heard ſpeak of that Maid, and that her Conduct was not to be blam'd: As for him, he was not ſurpriz'd at the common injuſtice of Men, who will not admit a Woman capable of performing actions of Valour, but make it their buſineſs to cry them down, upon the account of weakneſſes u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually incident to Women, though it cannot be deny'd there are great Souls in that, as in the other Sex. The good Meen of S. <hi>Aubin</hi> gave new Eloquence to his diſcourſe, which was applauded by all; and the Abbot, who was ſeldom us'd to yield, confeſs'd at laſt, that if the Story was not altogether true, it was at leaſt very probable. When the company broke up, S. <hi>Aubin</hi> continued reading without interruption: And having read the Book over, he reflected ſeriouſly on the condition he was in. He gueſs'd by what had paſs'd at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, what diſadvantage it was to him to have the Story of his Life in Print, which expos'd his Reputation to the different humours of the Readers: And fancying that probably there were more of the Abbots opinion, he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended it might be much to his prejudice; and what a trouble it would be to the Marqueſs <hi>D' Oſſeyra</hi> if he ſhould chance to know of that Book: This was the reflection moſt afflicted S. <hi>Aubin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:135663:80"/>As he was under this inquietude, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>D' Angoſſe</hi> came into his Chamber; and finding S. <hi>Aubin</hi> alone, ſaid, <hi>Mademoiſelle,</hi> 'tis in vain to endeavour concealing your ſelf long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; I have learnt who you are, and am come to offer you all the ſervice I can do you. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina,</hi> ſurpriz'd at the Complement, was forc'd to confeſs all, praying him to keep her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and aſſiſt her in deceiving thoſe who had a ſuſpicion of her. <hi>D' Angoſſe,</hi> glad to be her Confident, promis'd all ſhe deſir'd; aſſuring her he ſhould eſteem himſelf very happy to have the good Fortune to contribute any thing to her ſatisfaction. Company coming in, they chang'd their diſcourſe: <hi>D' Angoſſe</hi> preſently after withdrew, and taking delight in muſing on what had happen'd, he made ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon ſo extraordinary an Adventure. Being a
<hi>Gaſcoyn</hi> he could not think any thing too difficult, and being a Perſon of Quality and Merit, but of a ſlender Eſtate, he took a fancy he might perhaps Marry <hi>Mademoiſelle de Mey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rac,</hi> whom he knew to be a conſiderable For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: He preſently apprehended the Marqueſs <hi>D' Oſſeyra</hi>'s Paſſion to be a main Obſtacle; but eaſily flattering himſelf into hopes of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he ſo earneſtly long'd for, <hi>D' Angoſſe</hi> look'd upon the Marqueſs <hi>D' Oſſeyra</hi>'s Paſſion as matter of humour, and a meer piece of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: And reſolv'd to ply <hi>Christina</hi> cloſe, he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented her company with great aſſiduity. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> looking upon 't as an effect of his civility, was not backward in returning it, making him acquainted with her greateſt concerns, though
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:135663:81"/> (with a reſervedneſs uſual in ſuch caſes with thoſe of her Sex) ſhe ſpoke very modeſtly of her Engagement with the Marqueſs: This en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd <hi>D' Angoſſe</hi> to take an occaſion to tell her he was oblig'd, as her Servant, to inform her, the pretended Paſſion of the Marqueſs was entertain'd in the World as a very ridiculous thing, this being not the Age of thoſe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Heroes who would attempt any thing for their Miſtreſſes ſervice; but a Seaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the longeſt-liv'd Paſſion laſts not three Months: Adding, he ſaw no great likelihood of their Marriage, but could diſcover many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible difficulties lying in the way, which induced him to adviſe her to be undeceiv'd in time, and think of a better ſettlement; and not furniſh matter for new Stories. S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> had wit enough to perceive <hi>D' Angoſſe</hi>'s deſign, and thinking this diſcourſe a little too free, and having not the patience to endure advice ſo contrary to her inclinations: anſwer'd, ſhe had already thought of this buſineſs, but that there are ſome occaſions People are unwilling to hear reaſon in, and contribute to their being deceiv'd, though ſure to be ſo, and to ſmart for it. However that ſhe had not the leaſt cauſe to diſtruſt her Lover, but was extremely oblig'd to him, and ſenſible he would love her during life: This had been enough to have daſhed the hopes of any but a <hi>Gaſcoyn,</hi> whom nothing can diſcourage. <hi>D' Angoſſe,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all he had heard, reſolv'd to purſue his deſign.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:135663:81"/>
                     <hi>D' Angoſſe</hi> being one day in company with ſome Ladies of the higheſt Quality, reading the <hi>Heroine Muſqueteer,</hi> and ſeeming concern'd at her Adventures; he, to oblige the Ladies, told them he was aſſur'd the Party was at <hi>Paris.</hi> The Ladies (as curious as thoſe of meaner Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) pray'd him to enquire her out, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them a ſight of her, which he undertook to do. The Morrow he told S. <hi>Aubin</hi> all
<hi>France</hi> read his Story, and that he knew Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of very good Quality, who expreſt much concern for his Fortune, that it might be his advantage to make uſe of the occaſion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage two great Ladies in his favour. I have no broken buſineſs to manage, ſays S.
<hi>Aubin,</hi> that I ſhould need go a begging protection; nor will I make my ſelf the talk of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by truſting two Womens diſcretion with a Secret, which, if diſcover'd, will expoſe me to the raillery of all the Court: You have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to keep my Counſel, and I believe you will keep your word with me. <hi>D' Angoſſe,</hi> fearing her diſpleaſure, aſſur'd her again he would never ſpeak of the matter, and that ſhe might rely upon him in that particular.</p>
                  <p>A while after the Ladies (the one being the Ducheſs of — the other the Marchioneſs of —) complained to <hi>D' Angoſſe</hi> he had broken his word with them, and pray'd him to make new ſearch for that Maids Lodging, who they were aſſur'd was at <hi>Paris:</hi> He engag'd himſelf to do it, ſpeaking with ſuch an Aire, as made them believe his former failing was by wilful neglect, but that he would now aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:135663:82"/> ſatisfie their Curioſity. He was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled not a little, how to bring it about: S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin</hi> had already given him ſuch an anſwer that he durſt not propoſe it the ſecond time; on the other ſide, he was very unwilling theſe Ladies ſhould have cauſe by his failure to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion his addreſs, a quality thoſe of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try much value themſelves upon. He was loth to do any thing to anger S. <hi>Aubin</hi> yet very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to oblige the Ladies: At laſt he reſolv'd to rid himſelf of their importunities, without expoſing S. <hi>Aubin.</hi> He bethought himſelf of the Marqueſs of <hi>Meſples,</hi> a young Gentleman of <hi>Gaſcoign,</hi> who was then in the Academy in the <hi>Fauxbourgs</hi> of S. <hi>German,</hi> learning his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes. This Marqueſs had a delicate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and a Countenance perfectly Femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine: <hi>D' Angoſſe</hi> pray'd him to go along with him to the
<hi>Tuilleries,</hi> where he would order it ſo he ſhould be taken for the <hi>Heroine Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteer. Meſples</hi> having heard the Story, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to act the part. <hi>D' Angoſſe</hi> having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Ladies notice, they came to the <hi>Tuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries,</hi> and ſeated themſelves on a Bench: <hi>D' Angoſſe</hi> and <hi>Meſples</hi> came (as by chance) and ſate near them, on the ſame Bench, <hi>D' Angoſſe</hi> inſenſibly fell into diſcourſe with the Ladies, who ey'd very narrowly the pretended <hi>Heroine.</hi> They were ſo prepoſſeſt with the opinion of <hi>Meſples</hi> being a Maid, that they whiſper'd one another they could not be miſtaken: As for me, ſays the Ducheſs, I had no need of being told ſhe is one of our Sex; the ſight of her would have convinc'd me: Examine but her
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:135663:82"/> Face, the diſcovery will be eaſie. Being deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engag'd in diſcourſe, the Ladies ſtood up, and went with the two Gentlemen into a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Walk: The Marchioneſs not able longer to forbear declaring what ſhe thought ſhe was ſo well aſſur'd of, ſaid to <hi>Meſples,</hi> Really, Sir, your diſguiſe ſerves you to little purpoſe; for upon a ſlight obſervation of your Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, any one may perceive you are nothing leſs than what you appear. <hi>Meſples</hi> affecting to appear confoundedly out of Countenance at the diſcourſe of the Marchioneſs, ſeem'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely diſorder'd, which confirm'd the Ladies in their error. They had the good nature to take pitty upon him, and help him to recover himſelf, confeſſing they had intelligence from <hi>D' Angoſſe,</hi> and had deſir'd her acquaintance to offer her their ſervices. <hi>Meſples</hi> very courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly anſwer'd their civilities, but expreſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment againſt <hi>D' Angoſſe</hi> for being ſo eaſie, as to diſcover the Secret. They walk'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a while, and ask'd
<hi>Meſples</hi> a hundred queſtions; and he had the wit to anſwer them ſo, that he came off very well. The Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as ſure as ſhe was that <hi>Meſples</hi> was of her Sex, had a longing deſire to know whether her Breaſts were not hurt with her wearing ſo ſtrait a Habit. She ask'd him the queſtion, and without giving time for anſwer, ſuddenly unbutton'd
<hi>Meſples</hi>'s Juſtacorps up to his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, which upon view appear'd to be a Mans. <hi>D' Angoſſe,</hi> who never expected the Ladies would be ſo free, was extremely ſurpris'd: And
<hi>Meſples,</hi> ſeeing himſelf diſcover'd, fell a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:135663:83"/> laughing ſo vehemently he could not ſpeak a Word. The Ladies retir'd, much offended with the trick put upon them.</p>
                  <p>The next Day <hi>D' Angoſſe</hi> went to the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs's, and beg'd her Pardon a thouſand times for what had paſs'd; confeſſing ingeniouſly it had not been in his Power to keep his Word with them, S. <hi>Aubin</hi> having flatly deny'd his Conſent. This Confeſſion heightned the Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the Ducheſs, who at the length Pardon'd him on Condition he would get her a Sight of <hi>Chriſtina:</hi> He pray'd her to have Patience two or three Days, and he would endeavour in that time to find an opportunity to ſatisfie her. <hi>D' Angoſſe</hi> frequently viſited S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> and though he had not made a formal Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Love for
<hi>Chriſtina,</hi> ſhe diſcover'd it plainly by his deportment: The Condition of her Affairs oblig'd her to manage him as one who might be uſeful to her in diſcourſing her Kindred, and would be eaſily perſwaded to take a Journey into her Country, if her Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs requir'd it; ſo that ſhe went ſometimes with him to the Comedies and Opera's: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that time was preſented the Opera of <hi>Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and took very much; <hi>D' Angoſſe</hi> made uſe of the occaſion to take Places for S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin</hi> and himſelf, in a Box, ever-night. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving receiv'd his Ticket, he ſent the Ducheſs Word of it, and advis'd her and the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to take Places in the Box right againſt them, to have the better view of S.
<hi>Aubin;</hi> which was done accordingly. <hi>D' Angoſſe</hi> and S. <hi>Aubin</hi> having taken their Places, the two
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:135663:83"/> Ladies little minded the Opera, being wholly taken up with viewing S.
<hi>Aubin.</hi> Having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken exact notice of him, they thought they were not deceiv'd this time; yet the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs, who could ſcarce believe a Maid capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to run through ſo many Adventures, would be better ſatisfy'd. She ſent for a Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quey, who was a witty Fellow; and having ſhew'd him S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> bid him put off his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and having put on another Coat, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that Gentleman when he went out of the Play-houſe; but be ſure to do it ſo cloſely that ſhe might have a certain Account where he lodg'd. The Lacquey perform'd, and gave his Miſtreſs an Account. She and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs reſolv'd on a Frolick to try if S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin</hi> were in Truth the <hi>Heroine Muſqueteer,</hi> as they were made believe: After ſeveral Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients, propos'd and rejected, they pitch'd upon ſending him a Billet that Evening, which was to this effect.</p>

                  <p>They read the Billet ſeveral times over: The Ducheſs thought it too free, and would have burnt it; but the Marchioneſs told her it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd not, being written to a Maid, and by an unknown Hand. The Ducheſs, ſway'd with theſe Reaſons, call'd for the Lacquey; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving inſtructed him what to do, gave him ſtrict Charge of the Billet. The Lacquey being come to the Houſe where S. <hi>Aubin</hi> was quarter'd, went to his Apartment, and deliver'd him the Billet; which he read, and was not a little ſurpriz'd. Having read it, he was very much perplex'd, having a thouſand Thoughts in his Head not knowing what Courſe to take: He was fearful of engaging in an Affair might be difficult to get rid of: On the other ſide, he knew that a Lady of Quality, if ſlighted, is a dangerous Enemy: This, and his Natural Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, made him deſire the Ladies acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. He read the Billet over again, and ſeeing nothing deſir'd but what he thought might be granted, and judging others as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd as himſelf, he reſolv'd to follow the Lacquey; and having wrapt up himſelf in a Cloak, bid the Boy lead the way. Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the Reader may think a Maid ſcarce ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſuch a Reſolution; but he is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider our
<hi>Heroine</hi> was naturally couragious and bold, yet as tender of her Honour (in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:135663:84"/> the Eſſentials) as the moſt reſerv'd. I have heard her ſay, ſhe thought her ſelf ſafer in Mans Habit, than that of her Sex; as expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her more to Diſcourſe commonly us'd to Women, if tolerably handſome, which at length leaves an impreſſion. About Eleven a Clock the Foot-Boy led him through a little Gate, of which he had the Key for the purpoſe; S. <hi>Aubin</hi> ſtaid in a Cloſet while the Lacquey gave notice of it to the Ducheſs, who was then with the Marchioneſs. It ſurpriz'd them to hear the Gentleman was come, as appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they began to repent their haſty engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, fearing they ſhould meet with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Marqueſs <hi>de Meſples.</hi> The Ducheſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Lady of eminent Vertue, and highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to preſerve her Reputation, was upon ſending him away without ſeeing him; and poſſibly had done it, but for fear of her Letter, which S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> if a Man, (as for ought ſhe knew he was) might make very ill uſe of: The deſire ſhe had to have it again in her Hands, and her natural Curioſity, made her Reſolve to admit him entrance. The firſt Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities being over, S. <hi>Aubin</hi> being alone with the two Ladies, who ey'd him very narrowly, appear'd ſo handſome, that they believ'd him of their Sex. The Ducheſs, willing to get her Billet into her Hands, told him he might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have a very ill opinion of a Lady who appear'd ſo forward; yet ſhe thought ſhe could not do too much to make ſure of ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome a Gentleman: The Lady you ſee with me is my Confident, and we two fram'd the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:135663:85"/> Billet I ſent you. I fear it may appear too paſſionate, and being not ſo well acquainted with you as to leave in your Hands a Paper of that freedom, I deſire you to reſtore it me; hereafter poſſibly I may know you ſo well, as to put my Reputation into your Hands. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> preſently took it out of his Pocket, and the Ducheſs receiving it threw it in the Fire; and changing her tone, I muſt confeſs Sir, ſays ſhe, my Curioſity hath expos'd me to a great deal of folly. We have read a Book, call'd <hi>The Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Muſqueteer,</hi> and had a deſire to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſo extraordinary a Perſon. We were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd ſhe was at <hi>Paris,</hi> and that you were inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate with her: You will highly oblige us to bring us acquainted with her. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> was ſo aſtoniſh'd at the Diſcourſe, he had not a word to ſay: The Marchioneſs perceiving it, made uſe of that Moment for the Trial ſhe had unhappily made upon <hi>Meſples,</hi> and found what ſhe look'd for: The Ladies embrac'd our <hi>Heroine,</hi> and made her a thouſand obliging Offers of their Services. <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> aſham'd to ſee her ſelf diſcover'd, anſwer'd them with as much Civility as the Diſorder ſhe was in would permit. The Ducheſs conjur'd her to tell her ſincerely if all that was written of her was ſincerely true, and what was of the Author's Invention. The Ducheſs was ſo well ſatisfy'd with out <hi>Heroine</hi>'s Modeſty and Diſcourſe, that ſhe preſs'd her very much to take a Chamber in her Houſe, aſſuring her ſhe ſhould be us'd as a Perſon of Quality and Merit. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> refus'd, and gave ſo good Reaſons for it, that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:135663:85"/> the Ducheſs was ſatisfy'd, but pray'd her to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit her as often as poſſible: <hi>Chriſtina</hi> promis'd it, and after a long Diſcourſe, and mutual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of ſecrecy, retir'd. But for all their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of keeping her Counſel, ſhe doubted their performance; and could not rely on their Diſcretion without ſcruple and diffidence, which gave her no ſmall diſquiet.</p>
                  <p>About this time S. <hi>Aubin</hi> receiv'd news from <hi>Bearn,</hi> that upon a Report of his Death ſome of his Kindred had poſſeſt themſelves of part of his Eſtate. The Abbot
<hi>Dizett,</hi> who had the management of his Affairs, advis'd him to make a Journey to
<hi>Bearn,</hi> to diſſipate, by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, the falſe Report of his Death, and to take Order for other Mattrers. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> loth to go ſo far from the Marqueſs
<hi>D'Oſſeyra,</hi> and expecting, with impatience, the end of the Campaign in order to Marriage, choſe rather to hazard the loſs of his Eſtate, than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in Buſineſs that would Rob him of thoſe precious Moments he thought better beſtow'd in thinking of his Love. Upon a ſecond Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the ſame purpoſe, S. <hi>Aubin</hi> deſir'd <hi>D' Angoſſe</hi> to undertake the Buſineſs; he readily took the Charge of it, and ſet out for
<hi>Bearn</hi> within two Days.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Aubin</hi> reflecting on his Engagement to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit the Ducheſs, thought himſelf indiſpenſably oblig'd to be as good as his Word. He went to her, and was kindly receiv'd; there was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly good Company there. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> was treated in ſo obliging a manner, that every one took notice of it, and inquir'd who that young
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:135663:86"/> Gentleman was, and very few knew him. A Principal Lord of the Court had long been in Love with the Ducheſs, and viſited her fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, but found his addreſſes fruitleſs, and had no further advantage by them, than an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to gain an intereſt in the Servants by his Liberality. He was not diſcourag'd by the ſevere Vertue of the Ducheſs from ſeeing her often, in hopes to prevail with her at Long-run. The Count <hi>d' Ex</hi> (for ſo was the Gentleman call'd) was ſo far in Love, that he eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came jealous, and could not with patience en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to ſee how familiarly the Ducheſs convers'd with this Stranger: He queſtion'd the Maids of his Party about it, but they could not give him a ſatisfactory account; the Lacqueys were as much to ſeek as the Maids. He whom the Ducheſs had employ'd to carry the Billet to S. <hi>Aubin</hi> being no more proof than others of his Coat to the temptations of Gain, and finding no advantage from being his Miſtreſſes Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, would not ſlip the opportunity of getting ſomething from the Count on this occaſion. He told the Count of the Billet, and how he thought the Ducheſs became firſt engag'd with the Stranger, not forgetting the Paſſage at the Opera. Here I cannot forbear blaming the injuſtice of moſt Men, to be ſo eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the ill Conduct of Women: How many are there who are very Vertuous, yet have not eſcap'd being condemn'd for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd, upon the Report of Maid-ſervant diſſatisfy'd, or a Foot-boy miſ-inform'd? This Report paſſes to other Women, and ſeldom
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:135663:86"/> fails of coming to the Ears of one or other, who will be glad of the occaſion to ſpeak as ill of another, as ſhe knows her ſelf to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly ſpoken of; and will be ſure to divulge it very carefully, in hopes to confound the Criminal with the Innocent: The Story loſes nothing by the Carriage, every one adds ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſet it off the better; and there needs no more to deſtroy a Womans Reputation: Of which, I could give you ſeveral Inſtances.</p>
                  <p>The Count was much ſurpriz'd at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Lacquey: He believ'd it without examination, and his Jealouſie made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve much more: It fail'd not to repreſent to him, that a Stranger of Quality, perhaps as obſcure as his Name, was in favour with a Lady of her Merit and Rank, when ſhe ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him who was inferiour to few in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for Handſomneſs, Birth, or Imployment. This made him reſolve to be reveng'd of his Miſtreſs, by depriving her of her Favorite. The Count, though otherwiſe very civil, was haſty of humour, and fiery: His Jealouſie requir'd him to make his Rival a Victim, which the goodneſs of his Nature would hardly conſent to: It would have been no hard matter to ruine his Rival, but his revenge would not have been compleat, if ſome part of it fell not on his Miſtreſs. After much irreſolution, he pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a ſatisfaction no leſs cruel, than gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant: He had a Domeſtick, very witty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent, to whom he diſcover'd his deſign, and told him he intended to truſt him with the execution; that his firſt care muſt be to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:135663:87"/> find out a Wench who had been debauch'd through want of Money and Experience, and lik'd it ſo well that ſhe continued the Trade; that he could not fail of choice in ſo great a Town, and therefore muſt pick out the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt he could find, but ſhe muſt be ſuch as could do him a kindneſs he ſhould have cauſe to remember while he liv'd: And to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he was not to ſpare coſt or pains; but withal, to put her into excellent Habit, lodge her in the beſt Apartment of the Houſe, and inſtruct her how to counterfeit, in her deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a Lady of Quality. The Servant found a Perſon excellently qualify'd for the ſervice his Maſter deſir'd from her, and ſo witty, that ſhe quickly learnt her Leſſon. This was ſo well perform'd, that the Count, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to have S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> ſtolen away, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the care of it to the ſame Servant; and took him along with him to the Ducheſs's to ſhew him S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> to prevent a miſtake. S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> went commonly in a Chair, and uſually retir'd from the Ducheſs's at Ten or Eleven, Clock at Night. The Count's Servant having made the Chair-men drunk, got others to wait in their room: <hi>S. Aubin,</hi> at coming off from the Ducheſs, not finding his Chair-men, made uſe of the next at hand. Three Men, well-arm'd, had order to guard the Chair: One of them, by the way, whiſpers S. <hi>Aubin</hi> in the Ear, that a Lady of Quality, being paſſionately in Love with him, had order'd them to ſteal him to her, for they were able to force him. S.
<hi>Aubin,</hi> though ſurpriz'd at the Complement,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:135663:87"/> was ſo us'd to extraordinary Adventures, that he permitted himſelf to be quietly carry'd where the pretended good Fortune waited him: As ſoon as he was arriv'd, two Men ſeiz'd him, and led him in the dark up a back ſtair; and having croſs'd two Apartments, thruſt him ſomewhat rudely into a Chamber full of lights, and nobly furniſht: One of them who brought him thither took care to ſhut the Door faſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. The Illuſtrious Perſonage, who was there ready to receive him, would not give him time to know her, but took him about the Neck with demonſtrations of a paſſionate joy, as true as what is affected can be; you would have thought the rich Habit ſhe was in had made her forget the meanneſs of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. S.
<hi>Aubin,</hi> reſolv'd what to do, was not daunted at all, but anſwer'd her Paſſion with all the civility and reſpect imaginable: But theſe were not the Entertainments ſhe look'd for, and after long diſcourſe, the fair Lady ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in vain endeavour'd by an affected mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty to raiſe the Gentlemans Spirits, was quite tyr'd with his reſerv'dneſs, and attributing his want of boldneſs to the trouble he ſaid he was in at ſight of her; I come not, ſays ſhe, to give you trouble, but to receive Love from you: At this, ſhe hid her Face with her Fan, as if ſhe had been aſham'd ſhe had let fall expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſo free. S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> who thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than how to get well out of the Bryers, was in ſome hopes, obſerving her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, and aſſur'd her he had a great inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Love her, that he was unworthy ſo much
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:135663:88"/> favour, but would make it his buſineſs to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit it by his ſervices: I will diſpence with you in that point, replyes ſhe, and ſince I muſt tell you all, I deſire we may ſpend this Night to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> who could not believe what he had heard ſay of the impudence of ſome Women, and expected not ſo very plain Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, ſtood a while mute; and ſeeing no other courſe to take, fell at her feet (whom he thought had been a perſon of Quality) and confeſs'd ingenouſly he was a Woman: The poor Wench who was made believe ſhe ſhould be largely rewarded, was in a lamentable fear to loſe what was promis'd her, if it were once known ſhe had not done the ſervice expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from her: Which troubled her the more, for that ſhe had deſign'd the Money for ſeveral neceſſity uſes, particularly for get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting rid of that which made her ſo fit for the preſent purpoſe of her Paymaſter; ſhe then fell at S. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s feet, and told him word by word all the Intrigue, advertiſing him the Maſter of the Houſe, (whom ſhe knew not) was jealous of ſome Perſon of Quality. It was no hard Matter for S. <hi>Aubin</hi> to gueſs it was the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs, and reflecting with horror on the Regale provided for him, he made the Wench ſenſible it was their common intereſt to keep mutual ſecrecy, which was accordingly promis'd, and having agreed what to ſay; the Wench went to Bed, which ſhe took care to tumble ſo as if two had lain there: S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> lay upon the ſtools. And on the Morrow, a little before day, the Wench went according to order to give,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:135663:88"/> a Boy who was in an Anti-chamber hard by, notice of what paſt, aſſuring him he might when he pleas'd ſend away the Gallant, who was ſo foundly pepper'd, ſhe undertook he ſhould never forget that nights work. The Boy gave his Maſter this account, and he was very well ſatisfied. He ſent the Wench word ſhe ſhould blindfold her Lover, and perſwade him to be led ſo into the place Royal, it being too early to get a Chair: And it might concern her how ſhe got rid of him. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> well pleas'd to ſee an end of an Adventure had ſo terribly frightn'd him, forgot not to give her who had ſo faithfully ſerv'd him, ſome marks of his acknowledgment: His vertue prompt him to exhort her to live honeſtly, which he ſeconded with giving her ſome means to do it, he follow'd his guides, and aſſoon as he was at liberty, went to his Lodging to Bed.</p>
                  <p>When he had reſted ſufficiently, he went to the Ducheſs's aſſoon as he thought her in a condition to be ſeen, and prayd her to ſend one for the Marchioneſs, aſſuring her ſhe had news to tell them would make them very merry: Aſſoon as ſhe was come they lock'd themſelves up in a Room, where S. <hi>Aubin</hi> told them the particulars of the Adventure he had met with the Night before: The Ducheſs, who very well knew the kindneſs the Count had for her, and was ſufficiently acquainted with his jealous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, preſently ſuſpected he had the principal hand in it, which was confirm'd by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, S. <hi>Aubin</hi> related. To put it out of doubt, they agree'd that S. <hi>Aubin</hi> ſhould not
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:135663:89"/> for two days appear at the Ducheſs's, and that when firſt the Count came thither, the Marchioneſs ſhould inſenſibly fall into diſcourſe of S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> and the Ducheſs ſhould expreſs much ſorrow for his ſickneſs; which would certainly produce a diſcovery of the Counts thoughts of the buſineſs. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> vaniſht, the Count came, as he was wont, to the Ducheſs, and ſav'd the Marchioneſs the trouble of the Diſcourſe agreed on, by asking the Ducheſs why ſhe look'd ſo ſad: The Marchioneſs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd that S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> whom the Ducheſs had a value for, was ſick, and that ſhe was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bl'd for want of his good company: The Count was ſo glad at the news, that he could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear asking merrily, what he ail'd; the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs, who knew the reaſon of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſaid ſhe knew not, and proceeded no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>The Ducheſs, who liv'd very lovingly with her Husband, had told him the ſtory of
<hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina,</hi> and how ſhe had got acquaintance with that Maid in Mans Clothes: And being glad of an occaſion to make him merry, ſhe ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled not to tell him the Adventure of the Count, at which they laugh'd very heartily.</p>
                  <p>It was a fine time for going into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: The Duke having a Houſe within fifteen Leagues of <hi>Paris,</hi> was minded to ſpend ſome time there, and told his Wife ſhe would do him a pleaſure to bring ſome good company thither. The Marchioneſs being a very Jovial Lady promis'd to make one; they had a great deſire to have S. <hi>Aubin</hi> along with them, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:135663:89"/> the Ducheſs had invited him two or three times, but could not prevail: When he came to take his leave of theſe Ladies the day before their departure, the Marchioneſs told him, if he would not go along with them, ſhe would diſcover the ſecret of his Sex. S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> was loth to go far from <hi>Paris,</hi> for fear of expoſing himſelf (as 'tis ſaid) to new Adventures, though it was for another reaſon; yet he was ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with the Marchioneſs threats, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to go along: The Duke very glad, and they promis'd all to keep S. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel. When they were got into the Country, the Ladies thought of nothing but their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; Hunting, Gaming, walking and making good cheer took up their time: The Ducheſs having conſider'd that the Count continued his miſtake, and ſtill thought her Criminal, was troubled ſhe had not undeceiv'd him; ſhe ſpoke of it to her Husband, who thought ſhe had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it being ever to a Ladies diſadvantage to give any cauſe of ſuſpecting her Conduct. They reſolv'd the Duke ſhould write him a Letter to invite him into the Country: The Count, who thought very ill of that Journey the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs had taken, though he did not know S. <hi>Aubin</hi> went with her, was glad the Duke had given him the occaſion of viſiting them, and imagin'd the Duke had written without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting his Ducheſs. He got thither within two days, and was ſurpriz'd to find ſo good company; there care was taken at his firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival to have S. <hi>Aubin</hi> out of the way. After Supper the Marchioneſs ſaid, ſhe had lighted
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:135663:90"/> that day on the pleaſanteſt ſtory in the World: They pray'd her to acquaint the company with it; ſhe excus'd her ſelf, ſaying, ſhe had a very ill memory: With that, ſhe ſtept a little from the Table, and taking a Book out of her Pocket, where ſhe had writ what ſhe had to ſay, ſhe pretended to make uſe of it to help her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and ſaid that a perſon of quality had been jealous of a Maid in Mans Clothes, and ſo went on, giving an exact and particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all that had happen'd to S. <hi>Aubin</hi> at the Counts, and how he had been deceiv'd when he thought himſelf reveng'd: The Duke and his Ducheſs the mean while obſerv'd the Count, who knowing himſelf by the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be the Party intended, chang'd colour and countenance at every word: The Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs having made a ſtop at the feigned ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> the Ducheſs was earneſt to know if the Count had been diſabus'd: The Marchioneſs takes her Book in hand, and read that; the Lady principally concern'd, went ſhortly after into the Country, and having ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pl'd the leaving the Count in a miſtake ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageus to her, had pray'd her Husband to invite the Count to come and viſit them. But how did ſhe juſtify her ſelf, ſays the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs? My Book ſays no more, replyes the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs. This Gentleman, the Count, being newly arriv'd from
<hi>Paris,</hi> may probably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you. Never was Man more out of Countenance than he: The Duke pittying the Diſorder he was in, told him, S. <hi>Aubin</hi> was, <hi>The Heroine Muſqueteer;</hi> the Count begg'd
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:135663:90"/> the Ducheſs's Pardon, giving her many ſorry Reaſons to juſtifie himſelf, which ſhe little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued: They ſent for S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> having firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd the Count not to diſcover the Secret: They had good laughing at the Adventure; but the Count was ſo confounded at it, that he durſt no more ſpeak to the Ducheſs, and ſhortly after return'd to <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Aubin</hi> in the mean time was not ſo merry as formerly, the ſame Reaſon that ſtopt his Journey to <hi>Bearn,</hi> would not permit him to be long abſent from <hi>Paris</hi> with Patience: He expected News from the Marqueſs <hi>D'Oſſeyra,</hi> but receiv'd not any, though they had taken care to agree a way to maintain a Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. As he was walking one Day with the Ducheſs, he ſpy'd three Spaniſh Soldiers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning homewards from
<hi>Flanders,</hi> he ſpoke to them in Spaniſh, and ask'd them a hundred Queſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>s about the Marqueſs <hi>d'Oſſeyra:</hi> One of the Soldiers hearing him repeat ſo often the Marqueſs's Name, ask'd him boldly if he knew him, and had any Concern with him. I have been his Priſoner, ſays S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> and he us'd me ſo well, I ſhall acknowledge it while I live: The Ducheſs perceiving by S.
<hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin</hi>'s Countenance how glad he was to diſcourſe with the Strangers, was willing to give him time enough to do it at his leiſure, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd one of her Servants to entertain them that Day, and take care of them: They were ſcarce got into the Houſe, but S. <hi>Aubin</hi> found them out, and addreſſing himſelf to the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, who ſeem'd beſt acquainted with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:135663:91"/> he ask'd a thouſand Particulars concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. The Soldier aſtoniſh'd to find a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſo acknowledging, and perceiving him the Marqueſs's very good Friend, confeſſed he was his Domeſtick, and had by the way met with thoſe two Soldiers going for
<hi>Spain:</hi> But as for him, he went no further than <hi>Paris,</hi> on buſineſs from his Maſter: S. <hi>Aubin</hi> Raviſhed at the News and thinking himſelf concern'd in the Journey, ask'd if he had not Letters for <hi>Chriſtina:</hi> The <hi>Spaniard</hi> aſtoniſh'd to find him ſo well acquainted with the Marqueſs's Affairs, told him he had ſeveral for her: Give me
'em then, ſays <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> forgetting her ſelf to be S. <hi>Aubin.</hi> The
<hi>Spaniard</hi> look'd attentively on him, and with the cool Gravity uſual in thoſe of his Nation, anſwered, he would rather part with his Life: I am <hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s Brother, and a good Friend of your Maſter's, ſays S. <hi>Aubin.</hi> And you may truſt me with them; but the
<hi>Spaniard</hi> was not to be perſwaded out of 'em. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> ſeeing it, and being impatient to have a ſight of Letters ſhe ſo dearly long'd for, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd ſhe was
<hi>Chriſtina,</hi> and had that Day diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed her ſelf into Man's Habit for Hunting: Old Birds are not caught with Chaff, ſays the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> I'll as ſoon part with my Life as my Letters, which he bound with two or three Spaniſh Oaths, and quitting S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> went ſtrait to his Comrades, and ſet forwards im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately for <hi>Spain:</hi> S. <hi>Aubin</hi> was upon the point of following them to ſet upon 'em by the way, and force the Letters from 'em; but fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Conſequence of an Action ſo raſh in a Kingdom, where ſuch Violence is not allow'd,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:135663:91"/> he pray'd the Ducheſs to give Order for Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to carry him preſently to <hi>Paris,</hi> fearing if the <hi>Spaniard</hi> miſt of him there, he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn preſently for <hi>Flanders.</hi> The Ducheſs not knowing the Reaſon of this haſte, endeavour'd very civilly to engage him to a longer ſtay. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> vext at her unſeaſonable Civility, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted her with what had paſt between him and the
<hi>Spaniard:</hi> The Ducheſs, in Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to a Lover's Impatience, ſent Horſes the ſame day to wait S. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s coming by the way, who on the Morrow went off in her Coach, and in a ſhort time arriv'd at <hi>Paris.</hi> He fail'd not to go to the place where the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs would addreſs his Letters, and thought it requiſite to put on Womens Habit, leſt the incredulous <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſhould ſcruple delivering him the Packet: Soon after the
<hi>Spaniard</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd, and having deſir'd to ſpeak with <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina,</hi> he deliver'd the Letters, applauding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf much that he had not truſted them with a Young Gentleman, who would have ſurpriz'd him with Untruths; but he had miſtaken his Mark; for he could have rather parted with his Life, than his Letters. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent about reading her Letters, than hearing his Bravadoes, opened ſeveral which pleaſed her well: I would have inſerted them here for the Reader's Satisfaction; but there are a ſort of Letters very good for the Writer, and for the Party they are written to, but flat and inſipid to others who have not the Key to underſtand the Meaning, and apprehend the Delicacy of them: I ſhall only give you one I thought ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt to be underſtood.</p>

                     <hi>D' Angoſſe</hi> in the mean time was return'd from <hi>Bearn,</hi> and had, with the help of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot <hi>d' Izzette,</hi> happily ended what he had to do there on S.
<hi>Aubin</hi>'s account, and much to his advantage; for which <hi>D' Angoſſe</hi> expected no ſmall acknowledgment. He could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine but <hi>Chriſtina</hi> would at length be ſenſible of his affection for her: And when S. <hi>Aubin</hi> would have made him a conſiderable Preſent, proportionable to the Service he had done him, <hi>D' Angoſſe</hi> took it for an affront, and told <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina</hi> he thought himſelf not unworthy of her affection. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> was ſo well acquainted with the boldneſs natural to thoſe of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that it ſurpriz'd him not at all: But to undeceive him, once for all, told <hi>D' Angoſſe,</hi> he had a very high eſteem and value for him, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:135663:93"/> would evidence it on all occaſions; but intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for the future to order his Thoughts better, than to give him occaſion to forbear his company, and forbid him further Viſits; which he would infallibly do, if he continued to diſcourſe him at that bold rate. <hi>D' Angoſſe</hi> was too much a <hi>Gaſcon</hi> to be diſcourag'd at this, ſo that S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> to be rid of trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome importunities, was forc'd to change his Lodging.</p>
                  <p>There was about this time, a Report that the Confederate Army had inveſted <hi>Charleroy,</hi> and begun already to form the Siege: Moſt of the young Gentlemen at Court, and other Volunteers, left <hi>Paris</hi> upon the News, and went for the <hi>French</hi> Army, not doubting but the Marſhal <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> who Commanded it, would attack the Enemy in their Lines. The Army increas'd extremely in two or three Days, Volunteers coming in Poſt from all Parts, and not finding Horſes on the great Roads, ſome were forc'd to take by ways to furniſh themſelves, that they might come in time. The Marqueſs <hi>de Fervaques,</hi> willing to be there with the firſt, to ſignalize himſelf on this, and other occaſions, had the misfortune to be taken by the way, by a Party of the Enemies. The Officer who Commanded the Party, having ſeiz'd ſome Books among Monſieur <hi>Fervaques</hi>'s Baggage, open'd one, which prov'd the <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Muſqueteer:</hi> the Title made him eager to read it. This Officer had been bred Page to the Marqueſs <hi>D'Oſſeyra,</hi> and not a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd to find the Marqueſs's Name ſo often in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:135663:93"/> the Book, he ſent it the Marqueſs, who was extremely aſtoniſht at it.</p>
                  <p>While every one wondred at the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates Reſolution to lay Siege to <hi>Charleroy,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving formerly attempted it in vain. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> allarm'd to hear the expedition generally cry'd down as raſh and unadvis'd, and all <hi>France</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident it would come to nothing, began to be afraid for the Marqueſs <hi>D'Oſſeyra.</hi> He had not the patience to wait information, by the Publick News, what was become of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs; but puſh'd on by a Love, to which no difficulty was inſuperable, rid Poſt to <hi>Charleroy,</hi> pretending the cauſe of his Journey to be only a Deſire of Honour, natural to the <hi>French</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: Every Horſe-man he met by the way he fancy'd might be a Courier to carry News of the defeat of the Confederates. But when he came to the Army, he found the Confederates had been ſo wiſe to ſave him the fright his Love might have put him to for danger to the Marqueſs. They had, upon the approach of the King's Army, rais'd the Siege, as the beſt of their Game. The Confederates having made a very good Retreat, S. <hi>Aubin</hi> ſaw there was no cauſe of further Fear on their Account, the Marqueſs <hi>D'Oſſeyra</hi> being ſafe; but he could not find in his Heart to return for <hi>Paris,</hi> without giving the Marqueſs notice: He was ſo pleas'd with being ſo near the Man he lov'd beſt of any liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he reſolv'd to ſtay in
<hi>Flanders:</hi> And having engag'd himſelf in the beginning of the Campain to ſpend ſome time at <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> at <hi>Mariana</hi>'s Fathers, he took that occaſion to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:135663:94"/> continue nearer the Marqueſs: And conſidering it would be difficult hearing from him at <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciennes,</hi> where Count <hi>Magalotti</hi> the Governour was very ſtrict to prevent intelligence with the Enemy, he made ſure before-hand of a <hi>Ligeois</hi> Lad, who under pretence of carrying Victuals, went indifferently to both Armies; and was admitted into the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> as well as <hi>French</hi> Towns. The <hi>Ligeois</hi> having promis'd to ſerve him faithfully, he went into <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> and ſent the Boy into the

                  <p>This Letter was delivered S. <hi>Aubin</hi> at <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciennes,</hi> where he was receiv'd by
<hi>Mariana</hi>'s Parents with Demonſtrations of very great joy, and Evidences of a ſincere kindneſs. They flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd themſelves ſtill with the hopes of having
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:135663:95"/> him their Son-in-Law; and being confirm'd in this opinion, by his return, they made him very welcom, and gave him the beſt entertainment they could. Only <hi>Mariana</hi> appear'd troubled, at the Sight of S. <hi>Aubin;</hi> An <hi>Italian</hi> Captain in
<hi>Magalotte's</hi> Regiment, had, by his ſubtil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations, got that advantage over the ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the honeſt <hi>Hemyn,</hi> that ſhe told him all that had paſs'd between her and S. <hi>Aubin;</hi> and the deſign of her Parents to make her his Wife, notwithſtanding his great indifference for her. The <hi>Italian</hi> pretending himſelf very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for her, us'd all his endeavours to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her Thoughts of that chimerical Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, aſſuring her, S. <hi>Aubin</hi> who apparently was a Perſon of Quality, had no Thoughts of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying her, having not as much as Writ her a Line ſince he left her: I know, adds he, the French well enough, they engage themſelves with Women only for divertiſement, Ambition and thirſt of Glory are their predominant Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: But 'tis no ſmall Prejudice to a fair La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſo lovely as you are, to be expos'd to the ſlights of a preſumptuous Youngſter, who, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, makes ſport in his Countrey with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging Offers your Parents have made him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mariana</hi> having been frequently diſcourag'd thus, found it no hard matter to forget S.
<hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin:</hi> And the Captain finding her ſo well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, fail'd not to offer her his Service, and to make her ſenſible of the great Deſire he had to merit her good Opinion. 'Tis no wonder a young Maid, who fancy'd all Men as ſhy as S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> ſhould be taken at laſt with the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduity
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:135663:95"/> of a ſmooth tongu'd, and cunning <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian.</hi> Love, that you may be lov'd, is a max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im ſeldom fails, and whether it were that the Captain was in love with
<hi>Mariana,</hi> or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend'd it only, ſhe was quickly comforted for the abſence of S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> by the care this <hi>Italian</hi> took to entertain her with frequent Diſcourſes of the paſſion he had for her, and the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of S. <hi>Aubin:</hi> when he return'd to
<hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciennes</hi> ſhe had diſpos'd of her affection, and all her Parents cares to the
<hi>Frenchman</hi> were but ſo many pieces of mortification to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> who complain'd of them to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. But when ſhe reflected on her obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to him, and the Pleaſure of being behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſo handſome a Gentleman, her ſenſe of gratitude could not but reproach her for loving another. She acquainted the <hi>Italian</hi> with her reflections, who alarm'd at the Diſcourſe, made uſe of all the intereſt his ſubtilties gain'd in the credulous Girl: And conſidering he might never have ſo good an opportunity of making his Fortune, he was ſo fearful S. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence might revive <hi>Mariana</hi>'s former inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſo loth to loſe what he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf almoſt maſter of, that he made uſe of ſuch means to make ſure of <hi>Mariana,</hi> it was not in her Parents Power to diſpoſe of her to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He forgot neither promiſe nor oath, and preſs'd her ſo hard, that ſhe thought it but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to grant him the higheſt favour his Love could expect: her Mother reproach'd her for entertaining the Captain ſo conſtantly, and ſlighting S. <hi>Aubin.</hi> But her Mothers Diſcourſe
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:135663:96"/> and S. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s cold Civilities were merely thrown away upon her, who had receiv'd ſuch effectual proof of the Captains kindneſs: S. <hi>Aubin</hi> was ſo taken up with writing Letters to the Marqueſs <hi>D'Oſſeyra,</hi> and ſo pleas'd with reading his anſwers, that 'tis no wonder he concern'd not himſelf much with other Peoples Buſineſs.
<hi>Mariana</hi> having improv'd her Wit by converſing with the <hi>Italian,</hi> advis'd him to get acquaintance with S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> as an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means to be welcome to her Parents, by Reaſon of the eſteem and kindneſs they had for that <hi>Frenchman.</hi> Another Man would have ſcrupl'd ſeeing a Rival ſo dangerous as S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin,</hi> but an <hi>Italian</hi> hath an abſolute command of his Paſſion: The Captain diſſembling the hatred he had for S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> on <hi>Mariana</hi>'s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, did him all the civilities imaginable, of which the
<hi>Italians</hi> never are Niggards; S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin</hi> as courteouſly return'd them. The cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Italian</hi> eaſily had the advantage of the <hi>Frenchman,</hi> that in a ſhort time they were inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Friends: and the Captain, to diſcover S. <hi>Aubins</hi> deſigns upon
<hi>Mariana,</hi> frequently made her the ſubject of their Diſcourſe. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> frankly declar'd he had an eſteem for her. The Captain willing to try her further, and know whether he lov'd her, reply'd cunningly, that few are ſatisfi'd with a bare eſteem of a young Lady of <hi>Mariana's</hi> Qualities: I can go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſays S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> I have endeavour'd to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abuſe her Parents; and ſhould be very ſorry they ſhould, for hopes which can never take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, let ſlip the opportunities of ſetling their
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:135663:96"/> Daughter. The <hi>Italian</hi> well ſatisfy'd with an anſwer ſo agreeable to his deſires, concluded from S. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s Diſcourſe, he was very well born, and thought not of matching into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior family, which made him ever after make his Court to S. <hi>Aubin</hi> with extraordinary defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mariana</hi>'s Father was every day more and more charm'd with S. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s Behaviour and Carriage, and heartily ſorry to ſee him ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle concern'd for his Daughter. The
<hi>Italian</hi> frequented the Houſe under pretence of ſeeing S. <hi>Aubin. Mariana</hi>'s Father taking him to be a diſcreet Man, and one that had an intereſt in S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> whom he viſited ſo often, took an occaſion to tell him how much his family was ingag'd to S.
<hi>Aubin,</hi> and that he deſign'd to have him his Son-in-law, though he ſeem'd not very fond of the alliance. The Captain glad of this confidence, reſolv'd to make good uſe of it, he preſently fell to giving him Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and offer'd to ſpeak of the Buſineſs to the
<hi>Frenchman,</hi> which the Father accepted of with a great deal of Pleaſure. The
<hi>Italian</hi> being now become Mediator in the affair, conſulted <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> what anſwer he ſhould return her Father from S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> and amus'd the good Man with delays and put-offs to gain time for a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble occaſion, for <hi>Mariana</hi> to declare to her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents the neceſſity ſhe was under of being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd to the Captain. Lovers once Fortunate, flatter themſelves with hopes they ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſo ſtill: But a Cruel accident, which is ſo trobleſome to Marry'd Women, ſo terrible to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:135663:97"/> Maids, and ſometimes fatal to Widows, was like to have broken all the Meaſures theſe Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had taken. <hi>Mariana</hi> found her ſelf trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bl'd with qualms, and with fitts, occaſion'd by the familiarities of the <hi>Italian,</hi> ſo that ſhe thought it high time to make her Parents ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it: and believing her Mother more tender and compaſſionate (in ſuch caſes eſpecially) ſhe confeſs'd ingenuouſly the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſhe was in, and was ſo far from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of him who had caus'd it, that ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told his merit in very paſſionate to terms; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to keep the Buſineſs private, her Lover who had promis'd her marriage, having im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Reaſons to conceal it for ſome time. The Mother thinking ſhe ſpoke of S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> was ſo far from blaming her Daughter, that ſhe excuſed the matter, and promis'd to ſpeak of it to her Father, that order might be taken to have them privately marryed. The honeſt <hi>Fleming</hi> was ſo glad of the news of a Marriage he ſo paſſionatly wiſh'd for, that he preſently ſent for a Notary to draw the Marriage-ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein he gave his Daughter very great advantages in Favour of her pretended Husband that was to be: The two Lovers had ſign'd, and the Father had the Pen in hand for the ſame purpoſe, but miſſing S. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s name in the contract; he told the Notary, he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd on the like occaſions, that the parties to be married firſt writ their Names, and others aftewards to make good the contract as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents or Relations, to render it authentick as Witneſſes: Having ſo ſaid, he gave the Notary
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:135663:97"/> the Pen, which put <hi>Mariana</hi> into a terrible fright, and all the Wit the <hi>Italian</hi> had taught her was little enough to help her out: ſhe told her Father S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> was the Name of a Place, but that the Name he found in the inſtrument was that of his Family. This convinc'd the Father that he took the Pen again and ſign'd the Deed. Being one of the moſt conſiderable Burgeſſes of the Town, and willing to pay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Governour, he pray'd the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain who ſtood by, and paſt for S. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s good Friend, to accompany the Notary to Count <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galotts,</hi> and deſire his leave for the Marriage: The Governour having been poſſeſt of the thing by the Captain, and glad an Officer of merit had found an occaſion to make his Fortune, readily gave his conſent, and agreed the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony ſhould be perform'd that evening in his Chappel. <hi>Mariana</hi> had the Wit to order her Buſineſs ſo well, that her Parents went not to the Chappel, but rely'd on an Aunt of hers ſhe had gain'd: This was done with ſuch ſpeed, that S. <hi>Aubin</hi> was marry'd in the imaginations of <hi>Mariana</hi>'s Parents before ever he heard of it. The Mother gave ſo ſtrict a Charge to all her Family, to keep the matter private, that every one thought himſelf ſole confident of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue: while the Ceremonies were a doing, S. <hi>Aubin</hi> withdrew to his ordinary retirement. A Maid who open'd him the door, deſirous to inſinuate her ſelf into his Favour, whom ſhe look'd upon as her new Maſter, wiſh'd him joy: The Father ſeeing him enter, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that out of reſpect to him he was loth to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:135663:98"/> appear to him, till he had repair'd his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Honour, embrac'd him with great tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of Joy. <hi>Mariana</hi>'s Mother having ſpy'd her imaginary Son-in-law, would not give her Husband time to ſpeak, but took him about the neck, calling him her dear Son. S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> who underſtood not the meaning of their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome careſſes, thought them mad. As he was going to anſwer their impertinent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, a Friend of the Family, who alone was made privy to the Buſineſs, prevented him by giving him Joy: never was Man more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd than S. <hi>Aubin.</hi> He pray'd them ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to be undeceiv'd once for all, ſince for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubſtantial reaſons it was not in his Power to marry their Daughter. The Mother angry at ſo unexpected a Declaration, reply'd, that ſince thoſe Reaſons had not been ſtrong enough to keep him from diſhonouring her Daughter, they were too weak to diſpence with his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying her; adding, if he did it not, ſhe would puniſh their infamy by ſtrangling them both with her own Hands: The quarrel increas'd, and S. <hi>Aubin</hi> was in Danger of being ill us'd, had not the Governour come in with the new-marryed couple. This looks ſo like the laſt ſcene of a Comedy, that the Reader will ſcarce believe it. But I pretend not authority over Mens Opinions, I allow every one Liberty to think what he pleaſes. My Memoirs tell me
<hi>Mariana</hi> fell at her Parents Feet, and preſented them her Husband, whom they were oblig'd to receive, the Marriage having been celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all the formality uſual, and
<hi>Mariana</hi>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:135663:98"/> in a very hopeful Condition to make them Grandſires in a ſhort time. At laſt they were all ſatisfy'd, the <hi>Italian</hi> that he had got a good Fortune,
<hi>Mariana,</hi> that ſhe was Married to whom ſhe lov'd; and S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> that he was delivered from her Parents perſecutions.</p>
                  <p>But the Mind of Man is never Content, and the <hi>Italian,</hi> (like others ingenious in tormenting themſelves) though he ſaw himſelf Maſter, by his Marriage, of a conſiderable Fortune, and far beyond his Hopes; comparing the Plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of his preſent Fortune, with thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Wants all his Induſtry was ſcarce able to preſerve him from, he had a Crotchet in his Pate; there was ſomething more than ordinary in the matter, that a Gentleman of
<hi>Bergamo,</hi> no otherwiſe conſiderable than for a Company of Foot which he had gain'd by the ordinary means, ſhould marry a rich Heireſs, unleſs there were ſome ſecret Reaſons for it. In a word, his good Fortune had ſo refin'd his Fancy, that he paſs'd the ſame Judgment of his Wife moſt Men do, whoſe Wives ſuffer them before-hand to know what they ſhould have been ignorant of till after the Wedding, and imagin'd <hi>Mariana</hi> had been as kind to ſome other as to him. Of all he could think of, S. <hi>Aubin</hi> appear'd the moſt likely to be the Man: Having conſider'd it well, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded himſelf ſecretly for his Penetration, and was confirm'd in his Opinion that he had but S. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s Leavings, and was beholden for his Settlement to <hi>Mariana</hi>'s being with Child; who, not daring to let her Parents know it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:135663:99"/> to be marry'd to him, when S. <hi>Aubin</hi> had refus'd her: He doubted not but they had long held Correſpondence, and continu'd it; and loth to be any longer their Cully, reſolv'd to obſerve their Motions. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> who had formerly avoided being alone with
<hi>Mariana,</hi> that ſhe might not have occaſion to think he lov'd her, was often in her Company after ſhe was Marry'd; the Reaſon for abſenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being now over, and her Converſation more witty than formerly; ſo that having rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable good Company at Home, he thought he might well ſave himſelf the Trouble of taking it abroad. S. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s Aſſiduity with <hi>Mariana,</hi> gave the Captain new umbrage: He durſt not yet complain of it to <hi>Mariana,</hi> or forbid her his company: his Jealouſie the while repreſented the moſt innocent Actions as criminal. He was the more troubled to ſee moſt of the
<hi>French</hi> Gentry in <hi>Flanders</hi> going for <hi>Paris,</hi> when S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> who probably had no great Buſineſs at <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> ſaid not a Word of returning for
<hi>France,</hi> for which he could not imagine any cauſe, but Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with his Wife: He watch'd them ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly, that he quickly perceiv'd S. <hi>Aubin</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten imploy'd the
<hi>Ligeois</hi> into the Country, and at his return quitted all Buſineſs to ſpeak with him. The Captain's ſuſpicions made him fearful of every Shadow: He was very deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to know what Buſineſs the <hi>Ligeois</hi> was ſent about, and gave order to an <hi>Italian</hi> Foot-Boy, a very truſty Fellow, to hide himſelf in S. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s Chamber, and hearken diligently what
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:135663:99"/> the <hi>Ligeois</hi> ſaid. The Foot-Boy did as he was Commanded, and reported to his Maſter that the <hi>Ligeois</hi> ſaid not a Word, but gave S. <hi>Aubin</hi> a Letter which he read, very attentively, and ſigh'd often in reading it. The Captain, well acquainted with Love-tricks, was ſo poſſeſt with Jealouſie, that he preſently fancy'd the Letters were his Wife's, who perhaps had ſome Confident the Town who convey'd them to the
<hi>Ligeois.</hi> This ſuſpicion, how ill-grounded ſoever, gave our <hi>Italian</hi> no ſmall diſturbance. He reſolv'd to find out the bottom of the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and, with the help of the Foot-Boy, found the means one Day to draw the <hi>Ligeois</hi> into a Chamber of the Houſe, ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from S. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s, or any other Lodging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room: Having lock'd him up there, he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to run him preſently through, if he would not tell him truly whence the Letters came he carry'd S. <hi>Aubin</hi> ſo often: The <hi>Ligeois</hi> not knowing what Relation S. <hi>Aubin</hi> had to the Marqueſs, but judging by the good uſage of the one, and liberality of the other, that the Buſineſs was Moment, was very loath to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him; underſtanding how dangerous a matter it is to hold Correſpondence with an Enemy, eſpecially in a Place of War. The Trouble the <hi>Ligeois</hi> appear'd in heightned the <hi>Italian</hi>'s Curioſity, that he repeated his threats, and put himſelf in a poſture to execute them. The
<hi>Ligeois</hi> affrighted at it, prorms'd to tell him all, if he would but ſave his Life: The
<hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> promis'd it, and the Wretch made him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Correſpondence between S.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:135663:100"/> 
                     <hi>Aubin</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>D'Oſſeyra.</hi> The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſurpriz'd at the News, made no doubt but they held intelligence againſt the State, and was glad at Heart for ſo favourable an occaſion to be reveng'd of S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> under a pretence of Zeal for the King's Service. The ſmalleſt things are of conſequence in matters of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo that notwithſtanding his promiſe to the contrary, he made no ſcruple of ſecuring the <hi>Ligeois,</hi> the Maxims of <hi>Italy</hi> having taught him he was not oblig'd to be a Slave to his Word: He advertis'd the Governour; who, having queſtion'd the
<hi>Ligeois,</hi> ſent an Officer, with fifty Souldiers, to arreſt S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> who had receiv'd notice the <hi>Ligeois</hi> was a Priſoner; and though he knew not the Reaſon, yet he apprehended he might have let fall ſomething in diſcourſe about the Letters he brought him: and that they might not be ſeen, he burnt them; but it went ſo much againſt the grain, and he did it ſo ſlowly, that he was buſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this cruel Sacrifice, when the Officer ſent to take him entred his Chamber, and after a ſorry Complement or two led him into Priſon. The Officer fail'd not to give the Governour an account what he found in S. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s Chamber, and what a ſight of Letters there was in the Fire. This laſt Cicumſtance made every one think him Criminal, and that he had burnt the Letters to prevent their being made uſe of as Evidence againſt him. This Buſineſs made a great noiſe, and, as 'tis uſual on ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for every one to add ſomething to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, this rais'd the News that paſs'd then cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:135663:100"/> of a great Plot diſcover'd at <hi>Valenciennes.</hi> The <hi>Ligeois</hi> was examin'd very ſtrictly, and ſo frightned with the Tortures they threatned to put him to, that he confeſs'd all he knew, and a great deal more: His frequent Journeys to the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, the Money received from a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Enemies, and the burning of the Letters were evidences ſo clear, in the opinion of the Publick, that no doubt was made both the Wretches would ſhortly ſuffer. S. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s good Meen, and Curioſity, gain'd him Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion from all that ſaw him: Every one pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty'd, but none durſt excuſe him, for fear of being brought in as acceſſary to ſo tickliſh a Crime. He was the while under extreme per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity in Priſon, every thing ſeem'd to fall out croſs: His ſtay at
<hi>Valenciennes</hi> was look'd upon as myſterious, eſpecially after he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd he had no deſign to Marry <hi>Mariana.</hi> It was hard to juſtifie himſelf without confeſſing his Sex, which he could ſcarce find in his Heart to do. Being examin'd, he defended himſelf with ſaying he had written to the Marqueſs D' <hi>Oſſeyra</hi> as his particular Friend; but that his Letters had nothing in them that related to the King, or the State. The Judges were not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with his anſwer, and perhaps would have condemn'd him, had not the Governour inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd his Authority, at the requeſt of ſome La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to have the judgment ſuſpended till he might receive orders from the Court.</p>
                  <p>As they ſeiz'd what was in S. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, an Officer belonging to Governour had the Curioſity to read ſome Books found there.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:135663:101"/> Among the reſt, he read the <hi>Heroine Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer,</hi> where he ſaw the Names of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>D'Oſſeyra</hi> and S. <hi>Aubin</hi> ſo often repeated, that he fancy'd S. <hi>Aubin</hi> the Priſoner might be the ſame with S. <hi>Aubin Chriſtina.</hi> He told the Governour, and ſhew'd him the Book. The Governour read it with Pleaſure, and having, amongſt S. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s things, found a very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Letter of the Marqueſs
<hi>D'Oſſeyra</hi>'s, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the only one had eſcap'd the Fire, he was fully perſwaded S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> was the <hi>Heroine Muſqueteer,</hi> but was willing to be further aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd of it. He ſent for the Priſoner, ſhew'd him the Letter, and told him he doubted not but that which appear'd only a Letter of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, was a Cypher to cover ſome matter of State. S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> ſhew'd him ſo many Reaſons to the contrary, that the Governour believ'd him incapable of holding intelligence; but demanded of him a Letter to the Marqueſs <hi>D' Oſſeyra,</hi> to forbid further Correſpondence. This Propoſal put S. <hi>Aubin</hi> to the groan; and not able to give a good Reaſon for refuſing to write ſo, he appear'd ſo diſorder'd, that he thought it might be juſtly taken for a clear conviction of his Crime, yet this Trouble juſtify'd him more than all his Eloquence: For the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour imputing it to his love, diſcover'd him to be <hi>Chriſtiana,</hi> and no longer criminal. The Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs was huſh'd up, and S. <hi>Aubin</hi> ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The whole Town was glad of it, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially <hi>Mariana</hi>'s Parents, who ſtill had kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for him, and had been afraid to loſe him, the <hi>Italian</hi> had taken ſuch care to inform them daily of ſome new Circumſtance of his Crime.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:135663:101"/>While S. <hi>Aubin</hi> was in Priſon, the Captain, who made account to have his revenge of S. <hi>Aubin</hi> in the puniſhment the State would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict on him, could not forbear telling his Wife ſomething of it, and at the ſame time reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her with her falſeneſs. A Reproach a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man truly vertuous is moſt ſenſible of: And the Husband who uſes ſuch language to his Wife, doth but raiſe in her a deſire to be reveng'd of an unjuſt ſuſpition by real diſloyalty, when ſhe ſees him make ſo ſlight account of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation ſhe values her ſelf upon: <hi>Mariana,</hi> who no otherwiſe knew of any diſloyalty but by her Husbands Diſcourſe, and could reproach her ſelf for nothing but having been too credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, was ſo touch'd to the quick with her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands ingratitude, that ſhe reſolv'd to puniſh him for his Jealouſie; it was long ere her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment maſter'd her Vertue, being unreſolv'd whom to make choice of to aſſiſt her in her revenge: But when S. <hi>Aubin</hi> was ſet at liberty, ſhe fixt her choice on him; and looking on him as an Inſtrument very fit for her turn, ſhe us'd him more obligingly than uſual: Every Day ſhe reſolv'd to make him acquainted with her deſign, but when they were together ſhe had not the power to do it, flattering her ſelf perhaps he would gueſs at it. After vain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation he would ſave her the confuſion a complement of that Nature would put her in, ſhe acquainted him at length with the injuſtice of her Husband, but had not the Power to ſay all ſhe intended, ſhame ſtopt her mouth; and S. <hi>Aubin</hi> contented himſelf with blaming the
<hi>Italian,</hi> without making any offer of his Service to flatter her hopes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:135663:102"/>
                     <hi>Mariana</hi> not diſcourag'd at this, added, a Man of his Humour deſerv'd to have a Wife that would be reveng'd of him. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> reply'd coldly, it was an honeſt Womans part to think more of her Duty to her ſelf than her Husband. This would be ſufficient to keep her from any act of diſloyalty, and for his part he little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu'd a Woman who was reſerv'd on no other account but that of her Husband. <hi>Mariana</hi> who expected S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> would have offer'd to go halves in the revenge ſhe deſign'd, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſurpriz'd to hear him preach honeſty to her. And not able longer to endure the vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it gave her, retir'd into her Chamber, to weep it out there.</p>
                  <p>'Tis natural to deſire what appears difficult to obtain. S. <hi>Aubins</hi> reſiſtance heightned <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianas</hi> paſſion: to juſtify the diſcretion of her Lover ſhe fancy'd he anſwered her thus, only to pleaſe her, who he knew was no Lover of very free diſcourſe: I ſhould have explain'd my ſelf better, ſays ſhe, how elſe ſhould a Man I have always us'd hardly perceive a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den change ſo much to his advantage. With that ſhe reſolv'd to ſpeak more plainly; having obſerv'd her time to make a new tryal, ſhe told him ſhe had reflected on what he had ſaid to her of honeſt Womens Duty to themſelves, but found thoſe Reaſons too weak to reſiſt the motions of a predominate paſſion. I cannot endure my Husband, and the deſire I have to be reveng'd of a Man who makes ſo ill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of what I have done for him, makes me forget all I would have regarded on another occaſion: And ſince I am extremely
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:135663:102"/> concern'd to make to make choice of a diſcreet Man, I have pitch'd upon you: ſhe ſtopt there, thinking ſhe had ſaid enough: S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> who at firſt underſtood not what revenge ſhe intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thought ſhe would have made away her Husband, and abhorring ſo violent a deſign, blam'd her extremely, telling her, a Wife muſt bear much with her Husband, that the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt marriages are attended with trouble; and that if all Wives who are not ſatisfi'd with their Husbands ſhould take ſuch violent Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, no Man would dare Marry; adding, he would willingly adventure his Life againſt any one had offended her, but that he Thought it not the part of a wiſe Man to meddle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Husband and Wife. And leaving
<hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> (in the diſorder you may imagine) he thought fit to acquaint her Parents with the paſſages, and to take Meaſures with them to prevent further inconvenience; but he had the Diſcretion to tell them no more than that they would do well to prevent diſorders might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe out of ſome ſmall difference between the <hi>Italian</hi> and his Wife, for he perceiv'd they were both too much diſpos'd to quarrel: S. <hi>Aubin</hi> at their requeſt took it upon him to ſpeak to the Captain, and advis'd them the mean time to calm <hi>Mariana;</hi> he found out the <hi>Italian,</hi> and having told him he had ſomething of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to acquaint him with, he made him a long Diſcourſe of the extravagant Humours of moſt Women, and the unhappineſs of Husbands, who have not the Art of complying with their weakneſſes, inſuating, it was a wife Man's part to prevent Noiſe, and over handſomely the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:135663:103"/> extravagance of an humourſome Woman; the <hi>Italian</hi> not knowing what the Diſcourſe tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to; took it worſe from S. <hi>Aubin</hi> than he would from any Man, fancying he intended to inſult over him, by reproaching him with the eaſineſs of his Wife. Being a Man of Courage, he had not the patience to endure the Affront, but laid his hand on his Sword, without giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing S. <hi>Aubin</hi> time to finiſh the Diſcourſe. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> ſtood upon his guard, and defended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but they were parted without advantage on either ſide.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mariana</hi>'s Parents tyr'd themſelves with preaching to her to live in Peace with her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, when a Servant brings them News of a Duel between S. <hi>Aubin</hi> and the
<hi>Italian,</hi> which ſurpriz'd them all, though on different Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts: The Father-in-law believ'd his Son had ill taken the good Offices S. <hi>Aubin</hi> would have done him, and ſo occaſion'd the quarrel: <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> applying all to her Love, fancy'd S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin</hi> had a generoſity refin'd to that extremity, that he pretended himſelf unconcern'd for her, that he might be in a condition the better to vindicate her. But the revenge ſhe expected was of another Nature, ſuch as ſhe intended to ſhare in the Pleaſure of it with him who took it. The Captain arriving, complain'd to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi>'s Father of the injury he pretended done him by S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> and told him he would no longer endure the inſolence of that
<hi>Frenchman,</hi> who abus'd the reſpect they had for him. The Father heard his Complaints with Attention, and was ſurpriz'd at the News of an Intrigue between his Daughter and S.
<hi>Aubin,</hi> which
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:135663:103"/> might be likely enough: The Governour being told of the Quarrel, ſent for the Captain, who confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently told him the Reaſons he had to draw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on S. <hi>Aubin.</hi> The Governour not able to forbear laughing at a Jealouſie ſo ill grounded, brought the Captain to himſelf, by telling him S. <hi>Aubin</hi> was a Woman.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Aubin</hi> perceiving the ſecret he was ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to conceal, was grown publick, left <hi>Valenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennes,</hi> and went to <hi>Mons,</hi> being about five Leagues off, giving out he was an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the Houſe <hi>Crouy:</hi> The Duke of
<hi>Arſchot</hi> who was Governour, receiv'd him very kindly: and as diſtruſtful as he was of Strangers in a Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of that Importance, he could not believe a young Gentleman of ſo good a Meen capable of any ill Deſign. A <hi>Walloon</hi> Collonel, who had ſerv'd in
<hi>England,</hi> was very civil to him; and the Morrow after his arrival invited him to Supper. S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> was no ſooner come into the Collonels Houſe, but he ſaluted his Wife, ſhe was a Lady too well qualifi'd to be capable of ingratitude, and having been with her Husband at
<hi>Cambray</hi> when it was taken, ſhe preſently knew S. <hi>Aubin</hi> to be the Mareſchal
<hi>Luxembourgs Aid de Camp,</hi> who had complemented the Ladies there from his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; ſhe was extremely glad to ſee him, and to have that occaſion to expreſs her acknowledgment of his civilities: She fancy'd her Husband, to pleaſe her with the ſurprize, had brought him in as an
<hi>Engliſhman;</hi> and ſhe, to be even with her Husband, ask'd S. <hi>Aubin</hi> (as if ſhe had not known him) what News from <hi>England.</hi> S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> not perceiving himſelf diſcover'd, anſwer'd very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and like a Man of that Country, affecting
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:135663:104"/> to ſpeak broken <hi>French,</hi> and giving ſo exact an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Affairs, that the Collonel's Wife thought her ſelf miſtaken, in taking him to be S.
<hi>Aubin:</hi> She excus'd her ſelf for it, and her Husband made her miſtake the Subject of his Raillery all Supper-time. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> having dextrouſly eſcap'd diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very here, reſolv'd not to appear before the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs of <hi>Arſchot,</hi> knowing ſhe had great Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and would not fail to let her Friends know of it.

                  <p>S. <hi>Aubin</hi> having ſent this Letter to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> by a truſty Meſſenger, reſolv'd to wait an Anſwer in his Chamber, but was deceiv'd: For the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel's Wife having viſited the Ducheſs of <hi>Arſchot,</hi> for want of other Diſcourſe, told her of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Gentleman, who had ſupp'd the Night before at her Houſe, and how ſhe miſtook him for a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman ſhe had ſeen at <hi>Cambray:</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving added a great deal about his Wit and good Meen, ſhe rais'd in the Ducheſs a deſire to ſee him. The Collonel undertook to bring him to her, found him in his Chamber, and having magnify'd the good Service his Wife had done, in giving the Ducheſs a Character of his good Qualities, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to bring him to the Ducheſs. S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> vext
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:135663:104"/> at his officiouſneſs, excus'd himſelf with ſaying his Head ak'd. The Collonel, who expected not a Refuſal, and had engag'd to bring him, preſs'd him to go along, aſſuring him he ſhould not ſtay a Moment. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> was perplext, being loth to ſee the Ducheſs before he had an Anſwer to his Letter, and not well able to get rid of the Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel's importunity, he pray'd him to allow him a little time of reſt, and he would go with him in the Evening. The Collonel went away well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd with the promiſe, and S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> continued unreſolv'd what to do. Having thought well of the matter, and knowing the Ducheſs a Generous Perſon, he choſe rather to ſee her privately, and be known to her; than to expoſe himſelf pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to the ſurprize his diſguiſe might occaſion. He left his Chamber before the Collonel return'd, and being got to the Ducheſſes, ſent her Word there was a Stranger had Buſineſs of Conſequence with her, and deſir'd private Audience: The Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs went preſently into another Room, where S. <hi>Aubin</hi> was ſoon after admitted. As ſoon as S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin</hi> appear'd, the Ducheſs at firſt Sight knew who it was; and without allowing her time to ſpeak, kindly embrac'd her, expreſſing much joy to ſee her. S.
<hi>Aubin</hi> gave her a brief Account of Affairs, and the deſign brought him thither; and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it better to appear to the Marqueſs <hi>D'Oſſeyra</hi> in Maids Habit, pray'd the Ducheſs admittance once more into her Family; which the Ducheſs readily granted. All things agreed on, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman made as if he withdrew; and preſently after return'd by another Door the Ducheſs order'd to be open'd on purpoſe. S. <hi>Aubin</hi> had provided a Suit of Womans Cloaths at <hi>Paris,</hi> and having
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:135663:105"/> quickly ſhifted the Habit and Name of S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> into that of
<hi>Chriſtina,</hi> the Ducheſs produc'd her as a Gentlewoman of <hi>Lille,</hi> who was come to ſpend ſome time with her. It is the Prerogative of Great Ones to be believ'd without examination of Particulars by Inferiours; and <hi>Chriſtina</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by all, for what the Ducheſs declar'd her to be. The Duke of <hi>Arſchot</hi> was the firſt deceiv'd: The Collonel in the mean time return'd to S. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s Lodging, where he was told the Gentleman was gone. Reflecting then on what had paſs'd at Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he made no doubt but the pretended
<hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was the <hi>Frenchman</hi> his Wife had ſeen at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray.</hi> He was ſorry he had been ſo credulous, and reſolv'd not to appear at the Governour's, for fear of being ask'd News of the Stranger. The Ducheſs, willing to divert her ſelf with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, ſent for the Collonel and told him, that being his Friend, ſhe took that occaſion to let him know the Duke was much ſurpriz'd to hear he held Correſpondence with the Enemy, and had entetain'd at his Houſe, at Supper the laſt Night, a <hi>French</hi> Spy, though his Wife knew him to be an <hi>Aid de Camp</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg</hi>'s. The good Collonel, aſtoniſh'd at the Diſcourſe, pray'd the Ducheſs to continue his Protectoreſs; aſſuring her, by all that's ſacred, he was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and had taken that young Gentleman to be an <hi>Engliſh-man.</hi> The Ducheſs, pretending her ſelf ſatisfy'd, promis'd to clear him.</p>
                  <p>The Ducheſs of <hi>Arſchot,</hi> fearing to draw trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on her ſelf, writ to one of her Friends at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> deſiring Advice how to govern her ſelf, as to
<hi>Chriſtina;</hi> and whether the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would not take it ill ſhe entertain'd a
<hi>French-woman.</hi> The
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:135663:105"/> Ducheſs <hi>de Villa Hermoſa</hi> ſaw the Letter, and ſhe told her Husband of it. The Marqueſs <hi>D' Oſſey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> was in the mean time gone to <hi>Mons,</hi> in ſearch of S. <hi>Aubin;</hi> but could have no Account what was become of him. The Collonel inform'd of the Marqueſs's Arrival, waited on him to tender his Service; but finding him troubled S. <hi>Aubin</hi> was gone, he thought they had diſcover'd ſome Plot, and made haſte away for fear of being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended as having had a Hand in it. The Marqueſs could not, with decency, be long at <hi>Mons</hi> without viſiting the Duke and Ducheſs of <hi>Arſchot:</hi> He went to their Houſe, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd with all the reſpect due to his Birth and Merit. The Ducheſs, who gueſs'd the cauſe of his coming, perceiving, by the diſtraction appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Countenance, the trouble he was in, told him they had that Day ſurpriz'd a <hi>French</hi> Spy, drawing a Map of the Town; and that ſhe had much ado to prevail with her Husband not to cauſe him to be hang'd up immediately. The Marqueſs full of fear for S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> ask'd her, with much trouble, what was become of the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal You may queſtion him if you pleaſe, ſays the Ducheſs, for he is yet in my Chamber; and I am ſure you will be for giving him his Life: Having paſs'd in another Apartment, There is the Criminal, ſays the Ducheſs, ſhewing him
<hi>Chriſtina.</hi> The Reader may well think they embrac'd one another e're ſhe could make an end of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement. <hi>Christina,</hi> charming as ſhe was, appear'd much more ſo to the Marqueſs. They were both ſo well ſatisfy'd at the ſight of each other, after ſo many croſs Accidents, that they continued ſome time looking one upon another, not able to ſpeak
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:135663:106"/> a Word to expreſs their joy. They fail'd not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to ſay all the kind things two Lovers are capable of on ſuch an occaſion. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs thank'd the Ducheſs for the pleaſant Cheat put upon him, and confeſs'd he was come with a Deſign to Marry his dear Miſtreſs, and pray'd her the Ceremony of it might be perform'd at her Houſe. The Ducheſs, not expecting ſo ſudden a Roſolution, could not handſomly refuſe him; but deſir'd time to think on't, and to receive an Anſwer from <hi>Bruſſels;</hi> adding, he would do well to ſend a Courrier to the Biſhop for a Licenſe. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> ſaying ſhe thought that very neceſſary, and deſir'd it might be ſo; the Marqueſs ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a Gentleman expreſs to the Biſhop, and charg'd him to diſpatch that Affair with all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. The two Lovers, with a pleaſing Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, expected the return of the Courrier, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyc'd the while to ſee their Conſtancy ſo near be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Crown'd with mutual Enjoyment. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs was perſwaded <hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s Thoughts were altogether Heroick, that ſhe lov'd none beſide him, and was above the weakneſſes commonly incident to thoſe of her Sex. How odd ſoever it might appear, that a Man of his Quality ſhould Marry a Maid that had run through ſo many different Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, his Love, and the knowledge he had of the Vertues of his Miſtreſs, prevail'd with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other conſiderations. <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> who had not on any other occaſion been ſenſible of Love, but yielded her ſelf to the ſole Merit and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Marqueſs, was extreme glad to ſee her Troubles ſo near an end, and her ſelf upon the point of being united to the only Man of the World, who had the ſecret to pleaſe her, and ſhe
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:135663:106"/> thought worthy of her affections: But this Joy was ſhort-liv'd, and the ſatisfaction they had to be together ſome hours, ſeem'd granted them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to heighten the grief that was quickly to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon their Abſence from each other, with ſmall hopes of ever ſeeing one another again.</p>
                  <p>The Ducheſs of <hi>Benavidez,</hi> who, after the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Cambray,</hi> was return'd into <hi>Spain,</hi> and could not Pardon the Marqueſs <hi>D'Oſſeyra</hi> his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility, had inform'd his Mother of the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he had for <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> and had given her ſo ill-favour'd a Deſcription of that poor Maids Diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Adventures, that the Mother was perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her Son was bewitch'd: And attributing his Paſſion to ſomething ſupernatural, ſhe pray'd <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> (who had a reſpect for her, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving long Known her at <hi>Arragon,</hi>) to obtain an Order from the King, to the Governour of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> to obſtruct the Marriage of the Marqueſs with
<hi>Chriſtina;</hi> and (if need were) to interpoſe the King's Authority to prevent it. The Order was ſent into <hi>Flanders,</hi> as ſtrict as the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioneſs could wiſh it, and the Duke <hi>de Villa Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſa,</hi> very zealous for the Service of his Prince, and deſirous to demonſtrate an exact Conformity to the Orders of the Court, and repair, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming what was in his Power, the miſfortune he had to loſe many Places it was not in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to defend better than he had done; being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiz'd, by the Ducheſs of <hi>Arſchot</hi>'s Letter, of
<hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s arrival at <hi>Mons,</hi> preſently ſent thither the Captain of his Guatds, with the King's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der addreſs'd to the Duke of <hi>Arſchot,</hi> declaring he muſt be anſwerable to the King to have <hi>Chriſtina</hi> forth-coming. And being told the Maqueſs
<hi>D'
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:135663:107"/> Oſſeyra</hi> was gone from <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> he preſently thought him gone for <hi>Mons;</hi> which oblig'd him to diſpatch a Courrier thither, to tell the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs he muſt preſently attend him. The Couri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er arriv'd as ſoon as the King's Order; and the Marqueſs (from whom the Duke conceal'd the Order he receiv'd) believ'd the
<hi>French</hi> intended to attacque <hi>Bruſſels;</hi> and went away in all haſte, having taken leave of <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> and recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her earneſtly to the Ducheſs. When the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs came to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> he was extremely ſurpriz'd when the Governour ſhew'd him the Order from <hi>Spain,</hi> and pray'd him not to ſtir out of Town; for if he did, he muſt interpoſe his Authority to hinder him. The Marqueſs was upon the point of returning for
<hi>Mons</hi> in ſpight of the Governour's Orders, when a Letter was brought him from the Ducheſs of <hi>Arſchot,</hi> acquainting him ſhe was much troubled a Higher Power had put it out of hers to expreſs her reſpects for him in the Perſon of his Miſtreſs, who was now in a Covent, where ſhe ſhould be us'd very civily: but was not to be ſpoke with by any but the Abbeſs of the Place, the Order from <hi>Spain</hi> being poſitive in that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. This was a deadly blow to a Man in Love, as the Marqueſs; but it muſt be born with, and he muſt be content to write into <hi>Spain</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to obtain a Revocation of the Order. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons of the higheſt Quality writ in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> giving her the Character of an extraordinary Perſon; and that her Vertue, and excellent Qualities, deſerv'd to be us'd with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Reſpect. The good Offices intended the Marqueſs, by Letters ſo much to the advantage of his Miſtreſs, had an effect quite contrary to his
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:135663:107"/> Friends expectation. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> having been told of her, and ſcarce believing what was repoted of her, expreſs'd a great deſire to ſee ſo rare a Perſon: And having ask'd if it were not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to have her brought into <hi>Spain, Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> promis'd ſhe ſhould. It being <hi>Don John</hi>'s Cuſtom to make the King acquainted with the greateſt Affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> by way of Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as in the beginning of his Miniſtry he made him deſirous to learn to write, by ſhewing him a Letter from the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> all of the Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of that young Prince; and aſſuring his Majeſty he might, if he pleas'd, do as much in three Months. The King thought well of it, and learnt to write. Order was ſent to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the
<hi>Low-Countries,</hi> to Embarque <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina</hi> to be convey'd into <hi>Spain:</hi> the Duke <hi>de Villa Hermoſa,</hi> willing to ſave the Marqueſs <hi>D' Oſſeyra</hi> the Trouble the removing his Miſtreſs to ſuch a diſtance might occaſion him, kept this Order very private. When <hi>Chriſtina</hi> was told ſhe muſt go a Ship-board, ſhe was at Death's-door; eſpecially when ſhe heard ſhe was to go into <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Marqueſs to ſtay in <hi>Flanders,</hi> with ſo little hopes of ever ſeeing her more. Theſe Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made her forget ſhe had ever been S. <hi>Aubin,</hi> and yeild her ſelf wholly to the Sentiments of <hi>Chriſtina;</hi> her Love drawing Tears from her in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, which the fear of Death was never able to force from her. She took Shipping at <hi>Oſtend,</hi> in a Veſſel fitted, and arm'd on purpoſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey her for <hi>Spain.</hi> She was recommended with ſo much care to the Officers of the Ship, that they thought her a Princeſs of ſome Soveraign Family, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had ſtolen away for Reaſons
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:135663:108"/> of State. The Gentry of that Nation are great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorers of Women, and thoſe in the Ship us'd her with that reſpect, that help'd her to bear her mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes more patiently, a Woman, what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſoever ſhe is in, being ſtill ſenſible of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference expreſt for her. An Officer in the Ship (whether Lieutenant, or Enſign, I know not) poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt with an opinion of <hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s Highneſs, and having perhaps read in
<hi>Don Quixot,</hi> that the firſt Duty of a Cavalier is to ſuccour Ladies in diſtreſs, obſerving <hi>Chriſtina</hi> one Day all bloated with cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, watch'd an opportunity to ſpeak to her in private, and told her, if ſhe was ſo averſe againſt going to
<hi>Spain,</hi> as her tears and her ſighs gave him cauſe to believe, ſhe might ſignifie her pleaſure to him, who would bring her where ſhe deſir'd, or ſet fire of the Ship.
<hi>Chriſtina,</hi> well acquainted with the extravagance of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Ladies, doubted not but he ſpake in good earneſt; but looking on his Propoſal as impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, ſhe thank'd him, pretending ſhe would not conſent to it, for fear of expoſing a Gentleman of ſo much bravery to ſo certain danger. Who ever knows the humour of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> will eaſily believe ſuch an anſwer, from a fair Lady, was more than ſufficient to oblige this Officer to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake impoſſibilities for her ſake: He conjur'd her to employ him in her ſervice, aſſuring her he would endeavour to anſwer the good opinion ſhe had of his worth. <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> unwilling to act any thing raſhly, advis'd him to conſider a little of the matter; and becauſe they could not, without ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion, diſcourſe long together, ſhe pray'd him to put in writing the means he thought proper to bring about his deſign by: The Officer promis'd it.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:135663:108"/> As he was drawing up his Memorial, two Veſſels of <hi>Tripoly</hi> attack'd the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ship: I will not trouble the Reader with a tedious Relation of the Sea-fight, but acquaint him only that <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> chuſing rather to go into
<hi>Spain,</hi> where ſhe might hope to ſee the Marqueſs <hi>D' Oſſeyra</hi> once more, than to fall into the <hi>Turks</hi> Hands, did extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Actions in the Fight; and having obſerv'd a Souldier, who ſcarce knew how to handle his Arms, took them out of his Hands, and made ſo good uſe of them, that ſhe contributed very much to the ſhameful Retreat the
<hi>Turks</hi> were forc'd to make.</p>
                  <p>When all was quiet again in the Ship, the Captain and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, who all their Life had been under the Vulgar errour, that a Woman is incapable of Actions of Valour, were aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht at
<hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s dexterity and courage. They Complement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her for it, but having not in their Language Terms ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently expreſſive of their admiration, they expreſs'd it by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on her without ſpeaking a Word. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> are great Bouncers, much given to Hyperboles, one call'd her the Queen of <hi>Amazones,</hi> another ſaid ſhe was an Angel deſcended from Heaven for their Aid. They were ſo well ſatisfied with the Miracles ſhe had done (for ſo they call'd them) that had ſhe taken her advantage of the favourable diſpoſition they were then in, ſhe might have eaſily perſwaded them to land her in
<hi>France:</hi> But ſhe had a very ſtaid Wit, not apt to be led with Fancies, ſo that ſhe never thought of it. In the mean time the Officer, who had offer'd her his Service, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in the Fancy he had of her high Birth, by the Actions he had lately ſeen, took a new Reſolution to ſet her at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and blindly, following his fancy, drew up an extravagant Project, ſuitable to the Capacity of a Man bred very meanly. It was divided into Articles too ridiculous to be inſerted. The ſubſtance was,</p>
                  <p>That he would ſteal <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> by killing the Centinel at her Cabin Door; and becauſe this could not be done without noiſe, he pretended he had provided againſt it, by a hole he had made in the Magazin of Powder, at which he would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge a ſmall Gun, ſet fire of the Powder-Room, and blow up the Veſſel, as ſoon as they were got away, to a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:135663:109"/> diſtance, in the Long-boat. The only Reward he deſir'd for this brave Action, was to be ſent to <hi>London</hi> with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Ambaſſadour from the Princeſs, to deſire his Majeſty of <hi>England</hi>'s Protection. He was ſo pleas'd with the Fancy of his Project, that one Day he told <hi>Chriſtina</hi> ſhe would without fail be at liberty in few Days, all things being near ready, and preſented her the Paper; Read it, ſays he, and you will find I have taken my Meaſures very right. <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready no great opinion of his Wit, receiv'd his Memorial, imagining he might write with more judgment than he ſpoke. The extravagances of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> would at another time have made her excellent ſport: But now ſhe pitty'd his folly, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, coldly, her mind was alter'd, and that ſhe was very deſirous to ſee the Court of <hi>Spain.</hi> Any Man, but a
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> would have been offended at the ſlight; but what ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, a
<hi>Spaniard</hi> finds Fewel in it to feed the Fire of his Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: He reply'd, ſhe could not do better than go ſee the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Court, which, in his opinion, was the moſt Majeſtick of the Univerſe.</p>
                  <p>The Ship this while drew near the Coaſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina,</hi> not forgetting ſhe was ſtill further and further from the Marqueſs <hi>D'Oſſeyra,</hi> afflicted her ſelf every Day ſo much the more. As ſoon as they landed, the Maſter of the Veſſel took Poſt to carry the Duke <hi>de Villa Hermoſa</hi>'s diſpatches to Court. When he arriv'd there, they ask'd him a hundred ſeveral Queſtions about <hi>Chriſtina.</hi> He ſpoke much in commendation of her Beauty, but when he came to the Particulars of the Engagement with the Veſſels of <hi>Tripoli,</hi> he extoll'd to the Skies, the valour and courage of our
<hi>Heroine.</hi> This appear'd ſo ſtrange, in a Country where Women ſpend their time in an exceſſive ſoftneſs, and are generally fearful, that all who heard the News, ſpoke of
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> with great admiration. He who firſt gave the King an account of her, and occaſion'd his deſire to ſee her, fail'd not to acquaint him with what the Captain ſaid of her: The King was willing to hear the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelf, and ſent for him. The King's preſence, and the deſire to pleaſe him, inſpir'd Eloquence into the Captain, who gave his Majeſty an account of the Fight, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of what <hi>Chriſtina</hi> had done; which he diſplay'd with ſuch advantage, it heighten'd the King's deſire to ſee her. A Coach of the King's was immediately ſent away, to bring her with more convenience, and expedition to Court; where, by the diligence of the Perſon employ'd to attend her, <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> arriv'd in very few Days.</p>

Some confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently affirm'd ſhe was a Witch; but this ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous report vaniſh'd as ſoon as ſhe appear'd at Court, where ſhe anſwer'd exactly all the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions <hi>Don John of Auſtria</hi> ask'd her in the Kings preſence.

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:135663:110"/> ſhe ſpoke was pleaſing and well taken; to which her Modeſty, good Meen, and ſpeaking <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſo well, did very much contribute: The Court was well ſatisfy'd with her Diſcourſe, and the Prince <hi>Don John of Auſtria</hi> aſſur'd her ſhe ſhould be well us'd, and treated with reſpect: When ſhe was retir'd, the King, and the Prince his Brother, ſpoke much to her advantage: The Courtiers, as well out of a natural inclination the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have to ſpeak always in favour of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as of cuſtom, to approve whatever the King likes, highly applauded his Majeſties ſentiments. They made particular Obſervations and Remarks on all that appeared charming in <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> and diſcover'd ſuch excellency of Wit in expreſſions dropt caſually from her, that the King was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded they had done her wrong who had cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd her conduct; and of all thoſe Gentlemen who waited on his Majeſty, there was not one but could have wiſh'd himſelf the place of the Marqueſs <hi>d' Oſſeyra</hi> in her favour: <hi>Don John</hi> gave order ſhe ſhould have Lodging and Dyet at the Kings charge: Theſe diſtinguiſhing Favours, and the obliging character given her by thoſe who knew her, made ſeveral Ladies, of the higheſt Quality, very deſirous to ſee her. 'Tis not to be expected they ſhould have, for one of their Sex, the complaiſance of Gentlemen, who, taken at firſt ſight with the ſplendour of a beautiful Lady, obſerve not her defects, or at leaſt paſs over and excuſe them: Women, on the contrary, over-look, or (at beſt) take very ſlight notice of any thing that appears pleaſing and agreeable in another, and apply themſelves with diligence to magnifie and blazon all her imperfections, and whatever
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:135663:110"/> they believe diſpleaſing or unhandſome. As ſoon as the Ladies had ſeen <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> they blam'd their weak judgments who had cry'd up her beauty, and endeavour'd to make them ſenſible of ſeveral defects in it, though all the World is not yet of theſe Ladies Opinion in the caſe: The Counteſs <hi>de Benavidez,</hi> perceiving the preſence of <hi>Chriſtina</hi> would deface the ill impreſſions ſhe had given of her, endeavour'd to prepoſſeſs the Courtiers to her diſadvantage: But being fruſtrated on that ſide, and looking on the Ladies as better diſpoſed to ſerve her deſign, who are uſually pleas'd to hear any thing to the prejudice of one of their Sex, who has gain'd the reputation of eminent; ſhe ſpoke of <hi>Chriſtina</hi> with that ſcorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, that ſeveral of the Ladies were unwilling to appear in the ſame Room with her. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the diligence of the Counteſs, and the diſcourſe of the Ladies of her Cabal, the young Gentlemen of the Court lik'd <hi>Chriſtina</hi> very well: But the Count <hi>Talara,</hi> firſt Gentleman of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſties Bed-Chamber, no longer able to ſtifle the Flame kindled in his affections, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her company, and omitted nothing to make her ſenſible he was in love with her.
<hi>Chriſtina,</hi> perceiving it, did all that could be expected from a vertuous Lady to diſabuſe him, and us'd all the Diſcourſes and Arguments a Woman, who would diſcourage a Lover, and had no deſire to be lov'd, could invent on that occaſion: The Count <hi>de Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lara,</hi> not diſcouraged by her ſeverities, continued to love and wait upon her wherever ſhe was to be ſeen, being not of the opinion of that experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Lover, who ſaid it was in a Womans pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to deterr any from loving her, by a cold en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:135663:111"/> and at two or three ſeveral times telling them drily ſhe was not pleas'd with the addreſs. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> having follow'd this maxim, and ſeveral others for curing the Count, thought it in vain to diſcourage him any more, but reſolv'd (without giving her ſelf the trouble of undeceiving him further) ſo to order her actions, and ſhape the conduct of her Life, as not to give him cauſe of the leaſt hope of ſucceſs: The Count attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s ſlights to ſome particular averſion he apprehended ſhe might have againſt him, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy'd ſhe was otherwiſe inclin'd, and being a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon inferior to none, in handſomneſs, quality, or wit, was troubled extremely with this imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: To ſatisfie himſelf in this particular, he made ſome Perſons, who now and then viſited
<hi>Chriſtina,</hi> acquainted with his paſſion, and pray'd them not to ſee her any more. The Gentlemen of <hi>Spain</hi> have that deference and reſpect one for another, that a requeſt of this kind is not extraordinary there: <hi>Chriſtina</hi> very carefully avoided all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of being alone with the Count, and went frequently to Court to entertain his Majeſty with an account of paſſages in <hi>Flanders.</hi> And having one Day expreſt a great deſire to ſee the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> to know whether that famous Houſe anſwer'd the reputation it had in <hi>Europe;</hi> the King was glad there was any thing in <hi>Spain</hi> could move the curioſity of a Perſon who had ſeen ſo many varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and pray'd two Ladies of the Court to bear her company thither, to ſhew her the magnificence of that Pallace, and the rare deviſes in ſeveral Apartments there, which <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond put ſo great a value upon: Order was given the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhould be ſumptuouſly treated there: Count
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:135663:111"/> 
                     <hi>Talara,</hi> having heard of it, would fain have been one of the company, but was indiſpenſably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd by the Duty of his Place to attend the Kings Perſon, and as things then ſtood in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> there was no abſenting himſelf without manifeſt hazard of his Fortune. As he was think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Perſon he might confide in, to ſpeak in his Favour to <hi>Chriſtina</hi> on this occaſion, news was brought him that the high Steward of the Kings Houſhold, who was his Kinſman and Friend, was newly return'd from the Army in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> where he had a command; the Count gave him a viſit, and having confeſt he was deſperately in love with an excellent ſtrange Lady, who was to be on the morrow at the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> with ſeveral other Ladies; he conjur'd him to make uſe of the Priviledge of his Place, in going to the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, where it would be in his power to do him good offices with hia Miſtreſs, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of taking care of the Ladies. A Gentleman never refuſes an imployment of this nature, and this Friend of the Counts, readily accepting the charge he gave him, promis'd to acquit himſelf well of it. He fail'd not to go the next Day to the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> where, having given the neceſſary orders, he went into a Gallery the Ladies were walking in; who, having notice of his arrival, advanc'd to receive him, believing he had taken this Journey meerly out of reſpect to them: He had ſcarce begun to paſs a Complement of civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity upon them, but having caſt his Eyes on <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina,</hi> he ſtood ſtill as a Statue: The Ladies were aſtoniſht, eſpecially <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> who fixing her Eye earneſtly on him, knew him to be <hi>Don Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip de Palafox,</hi> of whom I ſpoke in my firſt Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:135663:112"/> as the Perſon who paſs'd the <hi>Pyrenees</hi> to ſteal her away.
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> cry'd out, frightned to ſee her ſelf ſo near a Perſon who had been deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in love with her, and one whom ſhe thought ſhe had highly offended. <hi>Don Philip</hi> had not heard of <hi>Chriſtina</hi> ſince he went into the Army in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> whence he return'd but once to Court, to take his Oath of High-Steward of the Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the Place being void by the Death of the Marqueſs <hi>Darizza</hi> his Father; ſo that 'twas no wonder he was ſurpriz'd at ſo unexpected a ſight of a Perſon who had been ſo dear to him, and by her inſenſibility had made him reſolve to go into the Army: Thoſe who have had any experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in Love, will eaſily agree, the ſight, after long abſence, of a Perſon we have tenderly lov'd and never prevail'd with, cannot but cauſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary emotions in the Heart of a Lover. All Men are apt to flatter themſelves in their paſſions, and <hi>Don Palafox,</hi> not able to imagine what ſtrange Fortune ſhould bring <hi>Chriſtina</hi> (a <hi>French-woman</hi>) into <hi>Spain,</hi> when the Two Crowns were ſo deeply engag'd in War, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fancy'd ſhe had repented her ill uſage of him, and probably was return'd into <hi>Spain</hi> in ſearch of him. And continuing to interpret all things to his advantage, he thought the ſlights Count <hi>Talara</hi> complain'd of, and the loud cry her late aſtoniſhment, at firſt ſight of him, had forc'd from her, effects of her paſſion for him. Being full of theſe fancies, he ſaid a thouſand extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances; and <hi>Chriſtina</hi> was ſo ſurpriz'd, ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd not a Word: The Ladies who ſtood by, taking notice of the aſtoniſhment, on either ſide, help'd to bring them to themſelves again; and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:135663:112"/> finding <hi>Chriſtina</hi> much diſordered by the preſence of <hi>Don Philip,</hi> they pray'd him to withdraw, which he could not deny them; yet hoped the diſorder he ſaw <hi>Chriſtina</hi> in boded him much good. He was no ſooner gone, but
<hi>Chriſtina,</hi> obſerving that the Ladies were in pain to know the cauſe of her trouble, yet ſo diſcreet as to forbear ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, acquainted them with what had paſt in her Country, and whatever elſe had any relation to her concern with <hi>Don Philip:</hi> This leſſen'd their wonder at her aſtoniſhment, and was eaſily believ'd by them, who were well acquainted with the headſtrong humour of that Gentleman.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Philip</hi> the while conſider'd the Accident he had newly met with, and being naturally vain, flatter'd himſelf with an Opinion <hi>Chriſtina</hi> was in Love with him. It was a pretty while ere he came to a Reſolution whether to return to the Ladies, or retire to ſave <hi>Chriſtina</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion he fear'd his Preſence would put her in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Company: After much Debate it was carry'd for the Retirement, in Confidence his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs would thank him for his Diſcretion, and eſteem him the better for't. Count <hi>Talara,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to hear the Succeſs of his Friend's Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, had given Order he ſhould have notice as ſoon as <hi>Palafox</hi> arriv'd: And going to his Houſe ſoon after his Arrival, he ask'd him, with much Concern, what News of his Miſtreſs: You have a Rival, anſwer'd <hi>Don Philip,</hi> who hath long been in Love with the fair <hi>French-woman,</hi> and he is a Gentleman I have a great Intereſt in, and my very good Friend. Know you not, reply'd the Count, thinking he meant the Marqueſs <hi>d'Oſſey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> that the King hath explained himſelf in that
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:135663:113"/> particular, and declar'd, He will not conſent to their Marriage: You ſurprize me, ſays <hi>Don Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> (not comprehending the Count's meaning,) I did not think the Court ſo well inform'd of the Affair. A Kinſman of <hi>Don Philip</hi>'s coming in, interrupted their Diſcourſe, and prevented far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Explication: The Count took his Leave, and
<hi>Don Pallafox</hi> remain'd very unquiet at the News he had newly told: Going to the King on the morrow, he found <hi>Chriſtina</hi> there, giving His Majeſty an Account of every thing worthy Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation at the <hi>Eſcurial:</hi> They ask'd if ſhe thought it a better Houſe than
<hi>Verſailles;</hi> there is no proportion between them, ſays <hi>Chriſtina, Verſailles</hi> being more conſiderable for the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and delicate Gardens about it, than the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of the Buildings, which are neat and convenient, but not ſtately; but the
<hi>Eſcurial</hi> is a Palace of very large Extent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Philip</hi> pretending he knew not this ſtrange Lady, ask'd thoſe who ſtood by, who ſhe was, while ſhe ſpoke to the King: They told him what they had heard of the Marqueſs
<hi>d'Oſſeyra</hi>'s Paſſion, the Fights ſhe had been in, in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and, in a word, all thoſe Stories the Publick had added to the truth of her Adventures. The King being gone to Counſel, <hi>Chriſtina</hi> retir'd, and <hi>Don Philip</hi> gave her his Hand to bring her to her A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, which ſhe would not refuſe him, for fear of notice being taken of it in ſo publick a place: As ſoon as he came where he might ſpeak to her in private, he aſſur'd her he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways lov'd her; and that if he had been guilty of Diſreſpect in endeavouring to ſteal her, ſhe ought to pardon it, as an Effect of the Exceſs of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:135663:113"/> his Paſſion, his Intentions having been always very good.
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> willing to diſabuſe him, told him, his Explications were to no purpoſe, ſince ſhe had diſpos'd of her Heart to another, and waited only a favourable Opportunity to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to the King of the Injuſtice of her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to entreat his Majeſty's Protection, if ſhe ſhould marry the Marqueſs <hi>d'Oſſeyra;</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that ſhe might have liberty to ſpend her Life in a Convent. With that ſhe burſt out into Tears, at the Thought of the Marqueſs; which <hi>Don Philip</hi> ſeeing, (that he might not afflict her more by Diſcourſe he perceived troubleſom to her) went away, but was ſo much concern'd for her, that he made it his buſineſs to be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the Particulars of her Affairs.</p>
                  <p>Having remembred himſelf that the Counteſs <hi>de Benavidez</hi> had reſided long in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> he gave her a Viſit, and falling inſenſibly into Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of
<hi>Chriſtina:</hi> The Counteſs gave him a Deſcription of her, much like that ſhe had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly given the Marchioneſs <hi>d' Oſſeyra,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others; inſinuating, that all her Diſguiſes were the Effects of a Criminal Paſſion; which <hi>Don Philip</hi> was ſo far perſwaded of, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented he had ever lov'd her: Moſt Men are diſpoſed to believe what they hear reported of the ill Conduct of Women, and the groſs Error of moſt Strangers, eſpecially <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in the hard Cenſure they paſs of the Liberty Women enjoy in <hi>France,</hi> did not a little contribute to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm <hi>Don Philip</hi> in the Sentiments the Counteſs had inſpir'd him with. He thank'd her for her Information, and having that Evening met with Count <hi>Talara,</hi> as the King was going to Bed, he
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:135663:114"/> told him he would cure him of the Paſſion he had for
<hi>Chriſtina,</hi> aſſuring him he knew by a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Hand, ſhe was unworthy the Affection of a Perſon of Honour: The King having that Inſtant call'd the Count upon Buſineſs belonging to his Place, he had not the time to anſwer <hi>Don Philip;</hi> and preſently after, every body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew: The Count, by this Priviledge of firſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the Bed-Chamber, was to lie there that Night: The Paſſion he had for <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> made him muſe all Night of <hi>Don Philip</hi>'s Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; at laſt, reproaching himſelf for having endur'd Language ſo much to the Diſadvantage of a Perſon he Lov'd, he thought himſelf oblig'd, as a Gentleman, to demand Satisfaction, and got up with a Reſolution to fight
<hi>Don Philip,</hi> though Duels are forbidden in <hi>Spain:</hi> But the Prince diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing very much with the ſeverity of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts, they are not obſerved there as exactly as in
<hi>France,</hi> ſo that Gentlemen fight Duels there on very ſlight occaſions. Count
<hi>Talara</hi> having writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a Billet to <hi>Don Philip,</hi> he deliver'd it to one of his Servants, a <hi>Navarrois,</hi> in whom he plac'd great confidence, commanding him to carry it to
<hi>Don Philip:</hi> Challenges being out of faſhion in <hi>France,</hi> I have inſerted the form of this, tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Word for Word, being as follows.</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>Whoever dares ſpeak to the diſadvantage of <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> lyes: She is of unqueſtionable Vertue; and he cannot be a Man of Honour, who judges o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe of her: If you are of a contrary Opinion, let me find you at one a Clock after Midnight, at the
<hi>Toledo-Gate,</hi> where you ſhall receive the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due for the wrong judgment you have paſt of her.</p>

                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:135663:114"/>The Count recommended this Billet ſo often, and with ſo ſtrict a charge to the Boy, that it gave him the curioſity to know what it contain'd. He was much ſurpriz'd at the reading it, and having been born near <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> and heard ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny extraordinary things of her, he had a kind of inclination for her, and thought he might do her ſome Service in letting her ſee a Billet ſhe was ſo much concern'd in; and ſlipt privately into her Lodging to ſhew it her: <hi>Chriſtina</hi> having given him ſome Fruits of her acknowledgment, charg'd him to carry it ſafe to <hi>Don Philip,</hi> and acquaint her with his anſwer, telling him, (the better to engage him to it) it was of very great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Philip,</hi> having received the Billet, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely offended with the outrageous Language the Count had made uſe of, and told the Boy it required no anſwer, but he would give his Maſter an anſwer at the place appointed. The <hi>Navar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rois</hi> gave <hi>Chriſtina</hi> an account, and then his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: While the Count was fitting himſelf to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at the aſſignation, <hi>Chriſtina</hi> was in Tears, unreſolv'd what to do. She conſider'd, that as things were carried, this Duel muſt needs produce very ill effects, ſince the Relations of both the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, would infallibly joyn with the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>d' Oſſeyra,</hi> to ruine her, and perhaps prevail with the Court to take ſome violent reſolutions againſt her. She was ſenſible likewiſe the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>d' Oſſeyra</hi> would be extremely diſpleas'd, to hear ſhe had been concern'd in ſo publick a manner, and in a buſineſs of ſuch noiſe in the Face of all <hi>Spain:</hi> A Woman, how ſmall ſoever
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:135663:115"/> a ſhare ſhe hath in a Quarrel happened on her account, being ſure to ſuffer by it; the publick (which judges of things by appearances, without examining the truth) being always ready to blame her: Having made theſe reflections, ſhe reſolv'd to prevent their fighting; ſhe had ſcarce form'd the deſign, but ſhe repented it, reproaching her ſelf for being ſo little ſenſible of her reputation, boldly and ſecurely wrong'd by <hi>Don Philip.</hi> With that ſhe gave her ſelf up wholly to what her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, her Courage, and deſire of Revenge ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her, and with the help of a <hi>French</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, got her a Suit of Mans Cloaths, a Sword, and a Perruke. About an hour before the time of the aſſignation, ſhe cunningly gave it out, the Count <hi>Talara</hi> was to fight a Duel; without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning <hi>Don Philip:</hi> This was enough to alarm the Counts Friends, who arreſted him in his Houſe. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> in the mean time went to the place of Rendezvous, and having ſpy'd <hi>Don Philip,</hi> though the Night began to grow very dark, ſhe attack'd him ſo briskly, that ſhe gave <hi>Don Philip</hi> a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Cut, which he had certainly reveng'd, had he not been inſtantly hem'd in by five or ſix Men, who ſeiz'd both the Combatants. Count <hi>Talara</hi>'s Boy, who lov'd his Maſter well, and fear'd the ſucceſs of the Duel, had given notice of it to a Gentleman who was both their Friends, and having got together ſome other, ran with them to the Gate of <hi>Toledo</hi> as they begun to fight: They had put out their Flambeaus for fear of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and 'twas ſo dark, they could not diſcern one Perſon from another, but haſtily ſeiz'd on them; and having put them into ſeveral Coaches, carry'd them to <hi>Don John</hi>'s Apartment, that the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:135663:115"/> Prince, who is extremely belov'd by the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, might take up the matter. But the Wound <hi>Don Philip</hi> had received, oblig'd them to take him to a Chirurgions, who (perhaps to heighten the value of the Cure) preſently ſaid it was very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, but that he would warrant the Cure. One of thoſe who had parted them was already got to <hi>Don John</hi> to advertiſe him of the buſineſs; and as he began to give him an account of the Particulars, he ſpy'd Count <hi>Talara</hi> ſtanding very quiet in <hi>Don John</hi>'s Chamber: He was ſo diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, to ſee there a Man he thought he had left in his Friends Hands in another Place, that it was not in his Power to continue his diſcourſe. The Prince, obſerving the aſtoniſhment of the Man, told him he had ſent for the Count, that he might be inform'd of the Affair, and that he would take care there ſhould be no Swords drawn. <hi>Don Philip</hi> is mortally wounded, ſays the Gentleman, and we thought it had been by Count <hi>Talara.</hi> They were all ſurpriz'd at this, eſpecially when told, that he that wounded <hi>Don Philip</hi> was in a Coach at the Prince's Gate. As they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the impatience to know who it was,
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> and her Company enter'd the Chamber. Every one wonder'd to ſee a young Man of ſo good a Meen. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> addreſſing her ſelf to <hi>Don John,</hi> inform'd him what had oblig'd her to diſguiſe her ſelf; and the courſe ſhe had taken for ſtaying the Count, that ſhe might revenge, in Perſon, the injurious diſcourſe of <hi>Don Philip:</hi> Her reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was commended by all, and her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage admir'd. The Prince, to divert his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty with the ſight of this diſguiſe, led her into his Majeſty's Chamber; telling him, as he enter'd,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:135663:116"/> he was come to beg his Majeſty's Pardon to be granted that Criminal, who had wounded one of the braveſt Men in his Kingdom. The King fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Eyes on
<hi>Chriſtina,</hi> preſently knew her, and thought the diſcourſe of the Prince, his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, had no relation to <hi>Chriſtina:</hi> But when he was inform'd of what had happen'd, he blam'd <hi>Don Philip</hi> extremely, for drawing that misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune on himſelf, and aſſur'd
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. <hi>Don Philip</hi> being ſoon after almoſt cur'd of his wound, <hi>Don John</hi> made him and the Count embrace one another, and oblig'd <hi>Don Philip</hi> to ask <hi>Chriſtina</hi> pardon. He was ſo aſham'd to have been wounded by a Woman, that he left the Court, and acccompany'd his Brother into <hi>Cicily,</hi> where he was to take Poſſeſſion of the Arch-Biſhoprick of <hi>Palermo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While matters went thus in <hi>Spain,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>D'Oſſeyra</hi> was in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> where the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs of <hi>Arſchot,</hi> who had a deſign to have him Marry'd to a beautiful young Lady her Relation, amus'd him continually, pretending to ſend him every day ſome News of <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> whom the Marqueſs thought ſtill in the Convent, ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful had they been to conceal from him her Voyage into <hi>Spain.</hi> He fancy'd the long ſilence of his Miſtreſs an effect of her Modeſty, as knowing her Letters were to paſs through the hands of the Ducheſs; and he expected every hour to receive Licenſe to return into
<hi>Spain,</hi> where he deſign'd to beg his Majeſty's permiſſion to Marry whom he pleas'd.
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> was allarm'd with continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al fears the Marqueſs had forgotten her, having heard nothing of him ſince ſhe left <hi>Flanders.</hi> The late Duel had occaſion'd a thouſand new
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:135663:116"/> Tales of her, in a Court where they are poſſeſt with an opinion Women are good for nothing but matters of Love, not a Perſon but was infinitely deſirous to ſee her; ſo that ſhe could not ſtir a foot but ſhe found her ſelf compaſs'd with a Throng of People, which made her reſolve to beg his Majeſty's leave to go into a Convent.</p>
                  <p>An Illuſtrious Princeſs, who owes her Birth to <hi>Italy,</hi> had her Education in
<hi>France,</hi> and by I know not what Freaks of Fortune is now in <hi>Spain,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard various Reports of <hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s Conduct, had the Curioſity to inquire ſtrictly into it; and to be ſatisfied of the truth of her Adventures, writ for that purpoſe into
<hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</hi> Soon after ſhe receceiv'd Letters which confirm'd the judgment ſhe had formerly given in her favour, and aſſur'd her,
<hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s diſguiſe was a pure effect of a Martial inclination ſhe had a little too eagerly purſu'd. This Princeſs, who by her own experience knew a Woman may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice to her Vertue, love Travelling, Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſeveral other Exerciſes, commonly look'd upon as proper only for Men, pray'd his Majeſty he would be pleas'd ſhe might take
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Houſe. The King was content, and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina</hi> accepted the offer with the greater acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, as being upon the point of entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Convent, where ſhe expected vexation e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from the Reflections of the Nuns, who though little acquainted with the World, might have waggery and malice ſufficient to torment her. 'Tis hard to expreſs whether the Princeſs was more ſatisfy'd with the good Humour and Complaiſance of our <hi>Heroine,</hi> or ſhe with the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and obligingneſs of her Protectoreſs: They
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:135663:117"/> agreed ſo well in their tempers, they quickly came to have an intire confidence in one another, and mutually imparted their moſt important Secrets.
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> having one day declar'd ſhe was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled there were Books publiſh'd of her Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. You have no reaſon to be troubled at that, ſays the Princeſs; 'tis my Fortune too, with this difference, that thoſe which concern you are true Relations of what hath happen'd to you; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I have not had a hand in any thing they have written of me, though the Writers have had the malice to interlard their Relations with Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſo probable, many take them for true. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> obſerving the Princeſs concern'd, advis'd her to publiſh an account of her Life, to diſown all others, and diſcover their falſities; and gave ſo many reaſons for it, that the Princeſs (who is a Lady of great wit) apply'd her ſelf to the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it on the Morrow. Her firſt deſign was to write it in <hi>French,</hi> as a Language ſpoken in moſt Courts of <hi>Europe;</hi> but having conſider'd there are few underſtand it in <hi>Spain,</hi> where ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to clear her ſelf, ſhe publiſh'd her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and ſome Copies of it have been tranſmitted into <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Princeſs lodg'd at <hi>Madrid,</hi> with a Lady of the higheſt Quality, and a Relation of the Prince her Husband. This Lady was a Widow, and one who more than any other, blam'd the leaſt liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Women take; ſaying there was little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a Woman really faulty, and one that's but ſuſpected; the Reputation of a Woman being ſo delicate, that a meer ſuſpition, however ill grounded, may ruin it. The Princeſs had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but in vain, endeavour'd to convince her of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:135663:117"/> her errour, and perſwade her that a Woman may be ſo vertuous as to have nothing to reproach her ſelf with; but it is not in a Womans power to ſtop the Mouths of her Enemies, from venting Stories, and Tales of her; which is too common in the World. The Widows ſeverity was proof to all reaſons. The Princeſs was diſcourſing one Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to
<hi>Chriſtina,</hi> the fooliſh and obſtinate conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of this Woman, and what difficulty there was in dealing with a Perſon wedded to ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and unjuſt an opinion, and that ſhe was troubled ſhe was oblig'd in decency to ſee her ſo often.
<hi>Chriſtina,</hi> who ſtudy'd to divert the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, promis'd her to Act a Part which ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive the Widow by her own experience: She was fully inform'd of all that paſs'd at the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and had obſerv'd ſhe was very ſhort-ſighted: She was a <hi>Catalonian</hi> by Birth, and would be thought to deſcend from the Ancient Counts of <hi>Barcelona.</hi> Whenever a Perſon of Quality of that Province came to Court, ſhe would be very angry, and think him ill-bred, if ſhe came not to do her homage. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> knowing all this, put on a Gentlemans Habit; and having taken order that if any came to the Gate, anſwer ſhould be made, the Widow was not to be ſeen that day: She gave her a viſit under the name of <hi>Don Artal de Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dona,</hi> newly arriv'd from <hi>Catalonia.</hi> The Widow, who was ſomewhat ſuperannuated, being much pleas'd a Gentleman ſo handſome and well born ſhould give her a viſit, and ſpeak ſo much in praiſe of her Family, (for <hi>Chriſtina</hi> had attacqu'd her weak ſide) ſhe gave <hi>Chriſtina</hi> the kindeſt recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on imaginable: Their diſcourſe was long, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:135663:118"/> before parting the Widow pray'd <hi>Don Artal de Cardona</hi> to do her the Honour to ſee her again of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: <hi>Don Artal</hi> promis'd it, and withdrew, and gave the Princeſs an account of the ſucceſs of the firſt viſit. She admir'd the Wit and Addreſs of <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> and pray'd her not to omit any thing to make the Widow in Love. The Princeſs having viſited her the ſame day, ſhe could not forbear falling preſently into Diſcourſe of the handſome <hi>Catalonian,</hi> and relate ſeveral Particulars to his advantage, being liberal of her Praiſes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling his Wit and good Meen; adding, ſhe knew him from a Child, and that then he promis'd great matters.</p>
                  <p>Two Days after, the pretended <hi>Don Artal</hi> went to ſee the Lady again, and knowing very well what Praiſes pleaſe a Woman beſt, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally one who is preciſe, and ſtands much on her Honeſty, he fell a commending her Vertue and Conduct, and by little and little ſlipt inſenſibly into the Subject of her Beauty. Diſcourſes of this kind never diſpleaſe a Woman, eſpecially a Widow, whoſe Condition, Age, and Pretences to Virtue oblige her to live retir'd. She heard all with Delight, and the Concern ſhe began to feel in her ſelf for this Gentleman, engaging her to eye him cloſer, and more attentively than before, he appear'd ſo handſome, ſhe thought ſhe had never ſeen any Man ſo lovely. A Woman in Years being more coming than others, at the third Viſit ſhe was deſperately in Love with him.
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> gave the Princeſs an exact Account of all, who not comprehending
<hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s Deſign
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:135663:118"/> to abuſe the poor Widow thus, ask'd her one day what ſhe propos'd to her ſelf by it: I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince her, ſays <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> how vertuous ſoever a Woman is, it may be accounted a piece of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in her to reſiſt the Attacks of a Man of good Meen, and ſome Indulgence is due to thoſe who are every day expos'd to Temptation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſtina</hi> ſometimes waited on the Princeſs to the Widows, becauſe they lodg'd in her Houſe, and took great Care to alter her Voice in diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with them. Being with her, ſhe had the Waggery to ask the Widow the Name of that handſom Gentleman ſhe ſaw now and then enter her Apartment. The Widow, tickled with the Praiſes <hi>Chriſtina</hi> gave a Man ſhe had a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for, told her a long Story of his Birth, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and many other Circumſtances; adding, he was her Kinſman, which was the reaſon ſhe allow'd of his frequent Viſits. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding all ſhe ſaid, found ſhe had diſcover'd the Secret to pleaſe her: And not ſatisfy'd with playing upon her under the Name and Diſguiſe of <hi>Don Artal,</hi> would needs be her Confident; which ſhe found no hard matter to attain, by continuing her Commendations of <hi>Don Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal:</hi> As ſoon as ſhe had ſhifted. <hi>Don Artal</hi>'s Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, ſhe would preſently run into the Widow's Chamber, to tell her ſhe had ſeen him paſs by, and that it was plain he was in Love. The Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow deceiv'd by a Diſcourſe that flatter'd her Deſires, and fearing <hi>Chriſtina</hi> might think <hi>Don Artal</hi> was in Love with another, and not with her, reveal'd to her at laſt what ſhe thought to have conceal'd from all the World, and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Secret of her Love for <hi>Don Artal;</hi> deſiring
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:135663:119"/> 
                     <hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s advice; who anſwer'd, that in matters of that nature ſhe had beſt conſult her own heart, and conſider the bent of her Affections; but that if any Paſſion were excuſable in a Woman, it muſt certainly be that ſhe entertain'd for a handſome Man: <hi>Chriſtina</hi> could not ſay this without bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and her Heart having reproach'd her for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſo free in her Diſcourſe, ſhe took her leave.</p>
                  <p>The deſire we have to prevail for ſomething we aim at, engages us often in more Diſcourſe than is neceſſary; and 'tis ſometimes very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to be eloquent. The Widow, reflecting on all <hi>Chriſtina</hi> had ſaid in praiſe of <hi>Don Artal,</hi> (which yet fell far ſhort of what ſhe thought he deſerv'd) concluded, from <hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s Diſcourſe, ſhe did not diſlike the <hi>Catalonian:</hi> And being through her Age more inclin'd to Jealouſie, ſhe reſolv'd to put a trick upon <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> by pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ſhe ſaid to her was only to diſcover what ſhe thought of <hi>Don Artal.</hi> The next viſit ſhe gave her, <hi>Chriſtina</hi> began (as ſhe had us'd) to ſpeak of <hi>Don Artal:</hi> The Widow interrupted her, telling her ſhe might do well to change the Diſcourſe; adding, very ſeriouſly, ſhe lov'd not the company of Perſons ſo coming: She ſpoke this with ſuch an Air of modeſty, it might have deceiv'd the moſt judicious. Poor
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> found her ſelf diſorder'd by ſo unexpected an anſwer, and her own Vertue cauſing her to approve of the Widows diſcourſe, ſhe went away much troubled and perplext, not having the confidence to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer a diſcourſe that reflected on her modeſty. When ſhe came to the Princeſs, ſhe complain'd of her misfortune in very lamentable expreſſions,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:135663:119"/> as if the moſt innocent actions ſtill turn'd to her diſadvantage. The Princeſs, who was very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, and very much miſtruſted thoſe Women who are over careful of outward appearances, told her, ſhe had run too haſtily into the Snare, and that poſſibly the Widow did but pay her in her own Coyn. <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> who had been frighted at this Adventure, took courage at the judicious Diſcourſe of the Princeſs, and reſolving to know the truth, put on her Mans Habit. The Widow the while applauded her ſelf for the gold ſucceſs of her Plot, in ridding her of ſo dangerous a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val: She expected, with impatience, her <hi>Cardona;</hi> reſolving, for the future, to take her advantage of the eagerneſs of his addreſſes: As ſoon as he came in, ſhe gave him the uſual reception; careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him in the higheſt manner imaginable, with deſign to inſpire boldneſs into him. And as cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as ſhe adher'd to her Vertue, her Love made her that Day expreſs a little forwardneſs, which
<hi>Don Artal</hi> ſeem'd not to underſtand. The Widow, who had a great opinion of his Wit, wondered to ſee him ſo dull; and was confounded at his changing his Diſcourſe, and falling upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of her high Birth, in terms which would have been pleaſing enough to the Vanity of the Lady, had ſhe not been that day under a ſtrong influence of the Planet of Love, which for the time had the Aſcendant of her Heart; and <hi>Don Artal</hi> very well knew it, though he had the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice not to take notice of it. She did all ſhe could to make him reaſſume the former diſcourſe, and he as carefully avoided it, magnifying the brave Actions of one of her Anceſtors, who had ſignaliz'd himſelf in driving away the <hi>Moors</hi> out
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:135663:120"/> of <hi>Granada.</hi> But ſhe was then indiſpos'd for War, and expected a Language leſs Martial, and more tender. <hi>Don Artal</hi> ſoon after took his leave, and the Widow remain'd very ill ſatisfy'd with his baſhfulneſs. The Princeſs, ſenſible of the diſtraction ſhe was under, thought it would be a Pleaſure to her, to have the liberty of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing alone of her imaginary Lover: and having learnt of <hi>Chriſtina</hi> all the Particulars of the laſt Scene, ſhe obſerv'd how careful moſt Women, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the preciſe, are to ſalve up the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, not much regarding the eſſential part, if they may but cheat the World, and be eſteem'd Perſons of a ſevere Life, and ſtrictly Vertuous: while thoſe who converſe much with the World, making ſmall account of ſome little liberties they take without ſcruple, are not ſafe from obloquy and cenſure, though really provided of a great ſtock of Vertue; while the others enjoy their Amours privately, and triumph in publick for the applauſe this counterfeit reſervedneſs procures them. In truth, ſaid the Princeſs, thoſe of our Sex are very unhappy in being oblig'd, beſides the ſatisfaction due to their Conſcience, to ſatisfie the World, which is always diſpos'd to believe the worſt of us.
'Tis certain, reply'd <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> we cannot always blame them, there being Women of all Characters who by their ill Conduct draw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves very heard Cenſures, and too often very deſervedly; though it muſt be agreed the Example of one guilty Woman, gives occaſion for condemning an hundred innocent.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> though they hate the memory of the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Sarazens</hi> expell'd <hi>Granada, Murcia,</hi> and <hi>Leon,</hi> by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and
<hi>Iſabella,</hi> yet
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:135663:120"/> they retain to this Day ſeveral of their Cuſtoms; particularly, their Gallantries, their Bull-ſports, and darting the Cane on Horſe-back, Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> is very much taken with, where Opera's are not known, and their Comedies (for the moſt part) ill. It was then a time of great rejoicing at <hi>Madrid;</hi> not for the taking of a Town, but to celebrate the Birth of their Monarch. The Princeſs was invited to ſee the Sports, and took <hi>Chriſtina</hi> along with her. I ſhall not give you here a Deſcription of theſe Sports which prove mortal to many, who think their Valour conſiſts in daring a Bull, letting fly at him with their Darts, and then retiring with much skill and agility, though it frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the Bull is too quick for theſe Gallants, toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes them in the Air, and gores them with his Horns; which ſometimes diſpatches them into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother World, and generally maims them in this. This piece of fool-hardineſs were excuſable in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary People, who are drawn to it by Cuſtom, and applauſe of the Populace; but cannot be too much blam'd in young Gentlemen of the beſt Quality, who hazard their Life to ſo little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in fighting with Beaſts as they do in <hi>Spain:</hi> where you may ſee them bravely mounted with a Dart in their Hand, expecting, in the middle of a <hi>Piazza,</hi> the coming of a Bull madded by the People; and though he come at them with a fierceneſs capable to aſtoniſh the higheſt courage, they bravely attacque him, and pierce him ſo dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly with their Lance, that ſometimes they run him quite through the Body: But you may alſo ſee the Bull ſometimes unhorſe them, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme peril of the Rider, and terrrible fright of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:135663:121"/> the Ladies. This Solemnity where this Princeſs and <hi>Chriſtina</hi> attended, was like others of the kind, where the fortunate raſhneſs of thoſe who came off well was applauded, and the tragical miſcarriage of others lamented. The Morrow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe bloody Sports, the Cavaliers run Courſes on Horſe-back, and dart the Cane as they run; which is done in this manner. They appear at the <hi>Barriere,</hi> with a Headpiece and light Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, made (one would think) of Steel poliſh'd white; and have commonly ſome Deviſe of gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, or ſome Motto on otheir Shields, and a multitude of Ribbands of the colour beſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes theier Miſtreſſes. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> had ſeen ſeveral of theſe Courſes, and having in the Armies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the moſt violent Exerciſes, ſhe thought this not very difficult, where all ſhe had to do was to ſpur her Horſe, and let fly a Cane with dexterity. She told the Princeſs ſhe would gladly run a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer, and ask the Widow for a Deviſe, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to aſſure her of her Paſſion. The Princeſs thought her in jeaſt; but our <hi>Heroine</hi> telling her ſee doubted not but to come of well, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs undertook to provide her fit Equipage; and <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> under the name of <hi>Don Artal</hi> of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dona,</hi> went to the Widow for a Deviſe, letting her know ſhe would run a Courſe for love of her, ſince other young People did it for their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, only he deſir'd her ſhe would give him a fitting Deviſe. The Reader may expect one of thoſe witty ones ſo uſual in <hi>Spain,</hi> but a Woman of her humour orders her Life quite otherwiſe than the reſt of her Sex: One ſo preciſe being no leſs careful to conceal, than an airy vain Coquet to make known ſhe is Courted: The Widow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:135663:121"/> to give <hi>Don Artal</hi> a Deviſe, telling him, ſhe was not of thoſe Womens humour, who judge of their Servants love by the Colour of their Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands. I rely not, adds ſhe, on ſuch ſlight ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, too often deceitful, I muſt have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proof of your Paſſion, to perſwade me 'tis real: (The truth is, ſhe expected ſuch proof as
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> could not give:) If you lov'd me, as you pretend you would rather ſtay with me while they are darting the Canes, and would be more willing to give me proof of your loVe in my Chamber, than in a publick place: what is done there generally ſerving only for matter of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Spectators. <hi>Don Artal</hi> aſſur'd her he lov'd her paſſionately, and thought to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her an Evidence of his eſteem of her, in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying her Colours and Deviſe at the Courſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to do any thing ſhe could deſire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince her of his love. Were your love as real and ſincere as you would make me believe, would you put me upon the neceſſity of appearing ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and not gueſs at part of what is expected from you?
<hi>Don Artal</hi> returning no anſwer, to a Diſcourſe ſo eaſie to underſtand, the Widow was ſo aſham'd ſhe had ſpoken ſo freely, and, with all, unſucceſsfully, that ſhe turn'd about preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and lock'd her ſelf in her Cloſet, for fear her Tears ſhould betray her. Being there alone, ſhe gave vent to a torrent of Tears diſpair forc'd her to; conſidering with her ſelf, that having liv'd ſeveral Years retired Mm Company, and free from thoſe Paſſions young Widows are uſually troubled with, (for at ſix and forty Years of Age ſhe counted her ſelf of their number) ſhe had the misfortune to be taken with the addreſſes of a
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:135663:122"/> hare-brain'd young Fellow, who perhaps deſign'd only to fool her: The next moment ſhe conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Glaſs, which telling her ſhe had Charms enough left ſtill to procure love, ſhe attributed <hi>Don Artal</hi>'s reſervedneſs, to the tenderneſs of his Years and want of experience: She was ſo pleas'd with this fancy, and thought it ſo reaſonable, that ſhe could no longer doubt but the timerouſneſs of her Lover, was a pure effect of his ſmall acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the World, being newly arriv'd from <hi>Barcellona,</hi> where he had not us'd to ſee Perſons of her Quality and Birth; beſides, ſhe knew young Country Gentlemen have ſuch Chymerical Idea's of Ladies of Quality;, that they think it enough to honour and admire them without daring to puſh on their Paſſion any further. While the Widow was thus deep in meditation, <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> ſufficiently aſham'd at what ſhe had heard, went back to the Princeſs, whom ſhe found buſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her Equipage for the Courſe, not doubting in the leaſt but the Widow had given the Deviſe: But when <hi>Chriſtina</hi> inform'd the Princeſs of her anſwer, (though her modeſty made her leave out ſeveral particulars) the Princeſs could not forbear laughing, eſpecially when told by
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> ſhe durſt go no more to the Widows, for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put out of Countenance, and quite ſham'd by her forwardneſs.</p>
                  <p>On the Morrow the Princeſs and <hi>Chriſtina</hi> were in a Balcony, near the King, to ſee the Courſes. As ſoon as the Gentlemen appear'd, all Eyes were fix'd to obſerve their Devices: Count <hi>Talara,</hi> as he paſs'd under the Ladies Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony, put off his Head-piece, making them a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:135663:122"/> low Reverence: His Motto was, <hi>Quiero mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho, y eſpero poco;</hi> that is, <hi>My Love is great, and my Hope ſmall.</hi> That concerns you, ſays the Princeſs to
<hi>Chriſtina:</hi> It put her to the Bluſh, and the King obſerving it, had the Curioſity to enquire the Reaſon: The Princeſs, very glad of an occaſion to divert him, gave him her Senſe of Count <hi>Talara</hi>'s Motto; and added, that <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> could, if ſhe pleas'd, perform Career as well as the beſt of thoſe where to run. The King ſaying he did not think it, the Princeſs conjur'd <hi>Chriſtina</hi> to make uſe of the Equipage (ſhe had provided) for one Courſe at leaſt. The young Monarch expreſs'd ſo earneſt a Deſire to ſee how well <hi>Chriſtina</hi> would come off, there was no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying him, and the Princeſs, their Requeſt. That leſs notice might be taken, ſhe pretended her ſelf not well, and withdrew. Her next Care was for a Motto ſomewhat anſwerable to Count <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lara</hi>'s; which, being very witty, ſhe was not long to ſeek. She caus'd theſe words to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on her Shield, <hi>No ay que amar, y me nos que eſperar de quien tienne duenno: 'Tis in vain to love, much more to expect Good from him who is already engag'd. Chriſtina,</hi> having ſet all things in as good Order as the ſhortneſs of the time would permit; appear'd boldly at the Barrier, and call'd for Canes, but was troubled with an Accident ſhe had not foreſeen: The Order was, That the Cavaliers who preſented themſelves for the Courſe, ſhould tell their Names, and make themſelves known to the Officers appointed to Regiſter them, to prevent Diſorder uſual on ſuch occaſions. Our <hi>Heroine,</hi> loth to Undergo that Law, was deny'd the Canes: The King, who
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:135663:123"/> had his Eye upon her, perceiving her in Diſorder on that account, order'd his Brother <hi>Don John</hi> to let them know it was his Majeſty's Pleaſure that Gentleman ſhould be diſpens'd with from telling his Name, or ſhewing his Face. The King's Pleaſure was no ſooner known, but Canes were deliver'd her: And her refuſing to ſubmit to the Rules of the Courſe, and the King's Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, gave cauſe to believe 'twas an extraordinary Perſon not willing to be known. This drew all Eyes upon her, every one gueſſing who it ſhould be. Great notice was taken of the Motto: Count <hi>Talara,</hi> obſerving the Oppoſition between it and his, deſir'd with Impatience to run a Courſe againſt this unknown Perſon, who manag'd his Horſe very well: But it was not probable <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina</hi> ſhould be as skilful at handling and darting the Cane, as the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who are us'd to that Exerciſe from their Youth: And 'tis certain our <hi>Heroine</hi> had run a great Riſque of being unhors'd, had not <hi>Don John,</hi> foreſeeing what might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, given Count
<hi>Talara</hi> a private hint the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger (he was to encounter with), was <hi>Chriſtina.</hi> You may eaſily gueſs the Effect this Intimation had on the Amorous Count, who was confirm'd in the Truth of it by the Motto he had obſerv'd on her Shield: He could not at firſt find in his Heart to run againſt <hi>Chriſtina;</hi> but having thought better of it, he put himſelf in a Poſture. The Count, who had already run ſeveral Courſes, with Advantage, againſt the moſt expert in the Sport, meeting the Stranger, pretended himſelf diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd and unready when he ſhould have darted his Cane: <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> without loſing a moments time, threw hers; which the Count appear'd ſo
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:135663:123"/> ſtunn'd with, that he fell off his Horſe: <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> was ſo confounded at the loud Acclamations of the People, (who judge of things by Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, without examining the truth) ſhe knew not whether ſhe had got the better or the worſe, till ſhe was preſented with a Roſe of Diamonds, the Prize appointed the Conqueror. Our <hi>Heroine,</hi> pleas'd with her Succeſs, retir'd, loth to hazard in another Courſe the Reputation ſhe had gain'd by this.</p>
                  <p>Count <hi>Talara,</hi> having had a ſore fall, was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried home to be blooded, which was much to the advantage of <hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s Reputation. The Count being known to be very expert at that Sport, the whole Court ſent to ſee how he did. And the Princeſs made
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> ſenſible of the Obligation put upon her by the Count, who had fallen off his Horſe of purpoſe, like a true <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gallant, and advis'd her to ſend one to inquire of his Health: <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> with ſome difficulty, conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it. The Count, raviſh'd with joy at the Complement, anſwer'd him who was ſent, that his fall did not much trouble him, but he had a Wound would not be quickly cur'd. It vex'd <hi>Chriſtina</hi> ſhe had given the occaſion for ſuch an anſwer, fearing the Count would pretend to ſome advantages for the Obligation he had put upon her. The Princeſs bid her ſet her Heart at reſt, and oblige the Widow with the Roſe of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds ſhe had gain'd at the Courſe.
<hi>Chriſtina,</hi> though fearful to engage further with ſo forward a Woman, comply'd however with the deſires of the Princeſs: She ſhifted her ſelf into her Habit of <hi>Don Artal,</hi> and preſently went to the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows Apartment, where ſhe found her very much diſorder'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="238" facs="tcp:135663:124"/>She was ſo preciſe ſhe would not appear at the Sports, but knowing
<hi>Don Artal</hi> would be there, and being much concern'd what became of him, ſhe had ſent a truſty Perſon of purpoſe to obſerve how things went, and bring her exact informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: He brought her the Names of all thoſe who were Regiſtred for the Courſe, but not his, for whoſe ſake alone ſhe had the curioſity to read all the reſt: She was much concern'd at the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him, a Woman ever paſſionately wiſhing the Glory of her Lover. Her Spy told her there was a Gentleman appear'd <hi>Incognito,</hi> and had refus'd to tell his Name; and that the King, to prevent diſorder, had diſpens'd with the formality; and that this unknown Perſon had unhors'd the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Count <hi>Talara,</hi> and retir'd with a Roſe of Diamonds of very great value. The Widow wiſh'd with all her Heart, this Unknown might be no other but <hi>Don Artal;</hi> but then thought ſhe, how ſhould a Youth, and ſuch a Novice in Love, be too hard for a Gentleman of ſo much skill and experience: with that <hi>Don Artal</hi> enters the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; ſhe preſently ask'd him what news of the Courſe, and why he had not been there. I was unwilling to appear, anſwers he, without your Deviſe; and ſince you refus'd it me, I had no Mind to ſhew my ſelf where you would not be. I knew you had not appear'd there, ſaid the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, though the good opinion I had of you made me hope you might be that illuſtrious Unknown, who ſo eminently ſignaliz'd himſelf, and carry'd the Prize; at leaſt my heart gave me none bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſerv'd it than you: but I ſee our Hearts of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten deceive us. You are not deceiv'd in that, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſays <hi>Don Artal;</hi> and ſee here (adds he,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:135663:124"/> preſenting her with the Roſe of Diamonds) the Mark you may know that unknown Perſon by, who hath had the good Fortune to deſerve your eſteem. The Widow, ſurpriz'd at a Preſent ſo glorious and unexpected, received it very gladly, and embrac'd the occaſion, ſo luckily given her, to preſent her Servant with a String of Diamonds of very great value, praying him to keep it as a Pledge of her Love. <hi>Don Artal,</hi> for fear of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring her, durſt not refuſe it; but finding ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fall again into very paſſionate expreſſions, he pretended buſineſs of haſt, and withdrew; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving promis'd to return on the Morrow, at an hour ſhe appointed. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> having ſhewn the Diamonds to the Princeſs, who underſtood Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els very well, was amaz'd to hear they were worth fifteen thouſand Crowns. This exceſſive Liberality fully convincing them of the violence of her Paſſion, <hi>Chriſtina</hi> had compaſſion on her, and told the Princeſs ſhe would diſabuſe her: The Princeſs having ſufficiently diverted her ſelf with the Intrigue, and thinking the Widow had puniſhment enough, ſaid nothing againſt it. On the Morrow, at the hour the Widow had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Chriſtina</hi> ſent her back her Diamonds, with this Letter.</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

                        <p>'TIS time to diſabuſe you, Madam; the <hi>Don Artal</hi> you love, is a Man in appearance, but really one of your Sex: I am in good earneſt, and unwilling to take the advantage of your Liberality, being incapable to ſatisfie your Love. You need not fear me; I am well acquainted with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our Sex, and know it a hard matter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt temptations; but I pity thoſe who have not the

                  <p>The Widow, who expected <hi>Don Artal,</hi> had not forgot any thing that might the better ſet off the weak Charms of a Woman of her age: She thought the Preſent he had made her, the Day before, a good Omen, and that ſhe had reaſon to expect ſomething better at the Aſſignation. She taſted before-hand a thouſand imaginary Pleaſures, and began to think long while her Lover arriv'd; when, lo, a Letter is brought her. The String of Diamonds preſently alarm'd her: and having read the two firſt Lines, ſhe ſcarce held up from ſwounding; her ſurprize was ſo great, ſhe fancy'd her ſelf not well awake. Having finiſh'd reading her Letter, and reflecting on the Beauty, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Circumſtances of her pretended Lover, ſhe believ'd all true that was written. She was not a little taken with her Generoſity, in ſending back her Diamonds; and out of a greatneſs of Soul, incidient to Perſons well born, which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary People are not acquainted with, or the love ſhe ſtill retain'd for the Memory of
<hi>Don Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> ſhe had the Generoſity to ſend back the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds to

                     <hi>Chriſtina</hi> having receiv'd this Letter, carry'd it to the Princeſs, telling her ſhe was much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with this String of Diamonds, and very ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous of keeping a Preſent ſo conſiderable. The Princeſs having read the Letter, advis'd her to keep the Preſent, and think no more of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and would not permit her to be further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Widow, (as <hi>Chriſtina</hi> deſign'd) knowing ſhe would owe <hi>Chriſtina</hi> a ſpight, for the diſcovery ſhe had made of her.</p>
                  <p>News was then receiv'd in <hi>Spain</hi> of the taking of St. <hi>Giſlain,</hi> by the
<hi>French;</hi> which very much allarm'd the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> who thought the rigour of the ſeaſon (it being <hi>December</hi>) would hate hinder'd, or delay'd at leaſt, the Conqueſt of the Place. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> vented their rage up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the poor <hi>French</hi> living in <hi>Spain,</hi> without ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe who had been thirty years Naturaliz'd. They ſeiz'd their Goods, baniſh'd their Perſons, and exercis'd upon them all ſorts of violence: Which is no new thing in that Country; for as often as the <hi>French</hi> take a Town, burn a Ship, or obtain a Victory, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeize all the Goods of the <hi>French</hi> who Trade in their Towns. Judge you then how many Preſſures they are expos'd to under the Reign of
<hi>Lewis</hi> the Great: This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ends in a great Tax laid upon them, after payment of which they let them alone for ſome time; but upon the next loſs they have, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution begins afreſh, which happens ſo often, that many have been forc'd to withdraw and quit the Country. A Merchant of <hi>Bearn</hi> of <hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:135663:126"/> acquaintance, and one ſhe was oblig'd to, found himſelf under this Storm rais'd againſt the <hi>French</hi> upon the taking of St. <hi>Giſlain. Chriſtina</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected him openly, having ſpoken in his favour to <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and repreſented to him the injuſtice done thoſe poor People, who ſettle there, relying upon their Letters of Naturalizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and with great labour and induſtry ſupply the Natural lazineſs of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> furniſhing them with a thouſand Conveniences they would never know but for the <hi>French.</hi> The Prince, at her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, caus'd reſtitution to be made this Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant of all that had been taken from him, and promisd to uſe the reſt favourably. This got our <hi>Heroine</hi> very great applauſe; but the hatred thoſe of
<hi>Spain</hi> naturally bear all Strangers, made them attribute the favour ſhe had obtain'd to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſupernatural: Which occaſion'd the reviving the ridiculous Report formerly gone about, of her being a Witch, and that with the help of her Art ſhe could effect what ſhe pleas'd. After ſo many extraordinary matters publiſh'd of her, 'tis no wonder the dull and ſottiſh People gave credit to this Report, while the Court laughd'd at it, and the Princeſs made ſport of it with <hi>Chriſtina.</hi> But her Enemies would not loſe the advantage of ſo favourable a Diſpoſition of the people. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs <hi>d' Oſſeyra</hi> and the Counteſs of <hi>Benavidez</hi> durſt not open their Mouths againſt her, ſince the Princeſs had taken her into her protection; but the favour <hi>Don John</hi> had granted her, awak'd the hatred of the one, and the jealouſie of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, leſt the Court ſhould at laſt conſent to her being Marry'd to the Marqueſs <hi>d' Oſſeyra.</hi> This made them reſolve to uſe all their endeavours to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:135663:126"/> foment the opinion of her being a Witch. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving learnt that
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> was that unknown Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who had unhors'd Count <hi>Talara,</hi> almoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out touching him; they took care to ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad this Circumſtance, and others, to confirm the people in their error. Their Artifice was ſo great, and their Emiſſares ſo diligent, that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral people of good ſenſe, deceiv'd by a number of probable Circumſtances, gave credit to this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Report. That was not all; for, cloaking their malice with a falſe zeal for Religion, they exhibited an information againſt
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> in the Inquiſition.</p>
                  <p>The Inquiſition is ſo formidable a Court, that the name of an Inquiſitor makes them in
<hi>Spain</hi> tremble, the ſevere puniſhments inflicted by that Tribunal on <hi>Jews, Moors,</hi> and <hi>Hereticks</hi> there, having gain'd it a high Reputation. The wiſer ſort ſpeak of it with, reſpect, the looſe hate the name on't, and the people generally have it in veneration. As ſoon as any Man is inform'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt in that Court, not a Courtier hath the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſay a word his favour, for fear of being brought in as an acceſſory, as they commonly are who are of a different Religion. The Kings Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is of no force at all there; and there is not one Preſident can be ſhewn, where the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Kings have intermedled with any Affair the Inquiſition had taken Cognizance of.</p>
                  <p>The people are ſo afraid of them, that when I was in <hi>Spain</hi> I was aſſur'd, that the Court being met one Afternoon, ſome of the Inquiſitors ſtood at a Window which look'd into a rich Burghers Garden, where was a Pear-tree full of excellent Fruit. One of them had a mind to ſome of thoſe
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:135663:127"/> Pears, and ſent his Man to deſire ſome of them; but the Gardiner having refus'd to give him any, the Inquiſitor diſpatch'd a Familiar (that is an Uſher of the Inquiſition) to tell the owner of the Garden the Inquiſitor would ſpeak with him: The poor Man was ſo frighted, he was ſcarce able to go to him; but recover'd himſelf again, being told they deſired only a Plate of his Pears: The Burgher promis'd to ſend it, and was glad he came off ſo. As ſoon as he got home he ſent the Inquiſitors all the Pears on the Tree; and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent being ſo frighted again, cut down the Pear tree.</p>
                  <p>To return to <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> the Inquiſitors having receiv'd the Information, caus'd her to be arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and, (which was worſe) left her in Priſon a Fortnight before ſhe was examin'd: 'Twas in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to her Sex ſhe was interrogated then, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordinary with them to keep a Man a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner ſix, or twelve Months before he be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. However the Princeſs, though advis'd to the contrary, labour'd privately for her, but to no purpoſe, it being not in her power to diſcover the particulars of her Charge. Our <hi>Heroine,</hi> who had no reaſon to fear the Inquiſition, upon the account of Religion, being Orthodox as her Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, was troubled at the noiſe ſhe knew this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs would make; not doubting but it would come to the Marqueſs <hi>d'Oſſeyra</hi>'s Ears, and that this, and her former misfortunes, would create in him an averſion againſt her, the diſaſters ſhe had met with, though innocent, being enough to draw upon her the ſlight of a Perſon of Quality: Her buſineſs the while look'd very ill. The Widow I have ſpoken of, having heard the news, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:135663:127"/> her having carry'd away the Prize, at the Courſe, from Count
<hi>Talara,</hi> made no doubt but ſhe was a Witch; and reflecting on what had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between them two, when ſhe took her for <hi>Don Artal,</hi> ſhe was in horror at the danger ſhe had expos'd her ſelf to, by Converſing with a Perſon, who, by the aſſiſtance of the Devil, could appear in what Form ſhe pleas'd; and was ready to make her complaint to the Princeſs, for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a one into her Houſe; and would have done it, but for ſhame of diſcovering her weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Yet, being ſcrupulous of concealing ſo ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating a Circumſtance againſt the Criminal, ſhe went to the chief Inquiſitor, and told him, that to diſcharge her Conſcience, ſhe came to inform him what had happen'd to her with that Woman in Priſon, who had ſeveral times appear'd to her in the ſhape of a young Gentleman of
<hi>Catalonia,</hi> call'd <hi>Don Artal de Cardona;</hi> but ſhe took care not to tell him the other particulars of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, chuſing rather to loſe her Diamonds, than to make it known ſhe had preſented <hi>Chriſtina</hi> with them, as a mark of her Love. The chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor, out of reſpect to the Widows quality, diſpens'd with her in ſeveral formalities, taking only her Hand to the Depoſitions, which was one of the ſtrongeſt Evidences in the Caſe. It is incredible what a noiſe this buſineſs made in <hi>Spain,</hi> where they could hardly believe a Maid could, without the-help of Magick, do Actions ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and ſo much above her Sex. It was the general diſcourſe, and they expected every day a ſolemn Judgment and Sentence, ſuitable to the Learning and Integrity of thoſe worthy, and able Perſons, who ſit on that Bench. The people had
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:135663:128"/> already ſet the day of her Execution, and, I believe, hir'd Windows to ſtand in to ſee it, Some among them, to colour the better their loſſes in the
<hi>Low-Countries,</hi> ſaid there was no reaſon to wonder at them, ſince this Woman had bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all their Generals. The Princeſs was amaz'd at the ridiculous ſtories ſhe heard every day of the unfortunate <hi>Chriſtina:</hi> The more ſhe juſtify'd her, the more they condemn'd her; and the leaſt good Office done for her, was very ill taken by the People, The very Court was troubled with it, the greater part not knowing what to think on't, the reſt ſuſpending their judgments till the Inquiſitors ſhould paſs ſentence: The firſt Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination was wholly ſpent in formalities. The Inquiſitors were ſurpriz'd at her confidence, and to ſee ſo little appearance of fear in her looks. This made the Reverend Judges believe ſhe truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much to her Art, or was innocent. Two days after ſhe was Examin'd again; the firſt queſtion was, what Charms ſhe had made uſe of to take the ſhape of <hi>Don Artal de Cardona?</hi> She anſwer'd, none other, but what people of Wit make uſe of to amuſe Fools: She told them at large, that the great ſeverity, or hypocriſie, of the Widow, made her deſire to put a trick upon her, by viſiting her under the name of <hi>Don Artal:</hi> The knowledge ſhe had that Lady could not ſee very well having encourag'd her reſolution for that divertiſement, in order to the rendring her leſs Cenſorious for the future. Then ſhe was ask'd, how ſhe could, with ſuch a ſlight Cane, un horſe Count <hi>Talara?</hi> She anſwer'd, He had notice before-hand, ſhe was to run a Courſe, and that his fall was rather an effect of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gallantry, than any
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:135663:128"/> Charms of hers. She was then queſtion'd what made her diſguiſe her ſelf ſo often, and in Habits ſo different? She anſwer'd, that, having from a Child had a ſtrong inclination for Arms, the death of her Parents had given her the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of following that noble Employment? In a word, her anſwers were ſo modeſt, and pertinent, that the Inquiſitors, being choice Men, and well ſeen in buſineſs, were perſwaded of her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. And, which is moſt to be admir'd, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Saragoſa,</hi> who was one of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors, and the moſt prejudic'd againſt her, knew her to be the ſame he had formerly ſeen in the Convent of <hi>Urſulines</hi> at <hi>Saragoſa;</hi> and had occaſion'd the reprimands he gave the Nuns, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his miſtaking her to be a Man: He told the other Inquiſitors the ſtory, and from a ſevere Judge, became her Protector, and Friend.</p>
                  <p>As terrible as the Inquiſition is in <hi>Spain,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fright Love. Count
<hi>Talara,</hi> extremely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for the Impriſonment of our <hi>Heroine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told by the Princeſs, the ſtrongeſt proof <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina</hi>'s Enemies made uſe of to deſtroy her, was the advantage ſhe had of him in the Courſe, was ſo troubled to hear ſo ill-uſe made of his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, that he put himſelf voluntarily into the Inquiſition, and deſir'd his Proceſs ſhould be made, declaring himſelf acceſſory to the Crimes of
<hi>Chriſtina.</hi> The Inquiſitors were aſtoniſht to ſee how eaſily he render'd himſelf Priſoner, and the People fail'd not to ſay, the Witch had by her Art forc'd him to't. The Count was exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and his anſwer was found to agree with <hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s. The Inquiſitors would have ſet him at liberty, which he refus'd to accept till our
<hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roine</hi>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:135663:129"/> had hers: Which was granted her on the Morrow, to the wonderful aſtoniſhment of all Fools: Count <hi>Talara</hi> was ſo troubled he had, though innocently, occaſion'd her perſecution, he never durſt ſee her more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſtina</hi> had the fate of moſt people in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, every one ſtrove to make her believe how much they were concern'd for her, (now the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was over.) The whole Court Complement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her upon her delivery, and the King had the goodneſs to tell her, he was glad to hear ſhe had clear'd her ſelf with ſuch credit. The Widow (fearing <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> to be reveng'd, would publiſh the Paſſion ſhe had expreſt for the pretended <hi>Don Artal</hi>) Courted her friendſhip, and aſſur'd her ſhe had never ſpoken againſt her, but to clear her Conſcience, <hi>Chriſtina</hi> had the goodneſs to pardon her, and they liv'd thenceforwards very good friends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſtina</hi> in the mean time was very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſhe had no news of the Marqueſs <hi>d' Oſſeyra;</hi> ſometimes ſhe was afraid he had forgot her, the next moment ſhe rejected that thought as injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the fidelity of her Lover, and in the end remain'd ſo perplext ſhe knew not what to think. The Princeſs, who had great kindneſs for her, perceiving her more penſive, and melancholy, than ordinary, did all in her power to divert her, and bring her into humour: She told her all the ſilly ſtories the people made of her Black Art, and gave her a hundred witty Jeſts on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> ſaid ſhe was not ſurpriz'd at it, having from her Chamber in the Priſon heard the diſcourſes of other Priſoners, of the horrible Crimes ſhe was accus'd of. Since you heard
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:135663:129"/> their diſcourſe, 'tis not poſſible, reply'd the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, but you muſt be well acquainted with their affairs, it being commonly a comfort to one in Miſery to relate and declare a Misfortune; and the ordinlry entertainment of Priſoners, is to tell one another by what Miſchance they came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I confeſs, ſaid <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> I have hearken'd to them ſometimes, with a great deal of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but moſt of thoſe who are Priſoners in the Inquiſition, being charg'd with impiety, or ſome other Crime relating to Religion, they are very miſtruſtful, every one taking his Fellow for a Spy, or a Trepan: Yet I remember I often heard the Complaints of a Souldier, who blam'd extremely the Ingratitude of his Country, in retaining him Priſoner in the Inquiſition, for Actions which would have been highly rewarded in a well-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd State.</p>
                  <p>He boaſted of great Services he had done his Catholick Majeſty in <hi>Flanders;</hi> where, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Regiments grow thin, he marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Wife at <hi>Conde,</hi> by whom he had two Boys: But the Place being afterwards taken by his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, he was made a Priſoner of War, and never knew more what became of his Wife. Upon exchange of Priſoners he was not long after ſet at liberty, and was in Garriſon at <hi>Aire,</hi> where he married another Wife; but that Place having alſo been taken afterwards by the <hi>French,</hi> he was carry'd to <hi>Cambray,</hi> where he thought himſelf ſecure: There he marrried a Third Wife, which began to rejoice his Heart with her fruitfulneſs, when that Place alſo was taken by the moſt Chriſtian King in Perſon; that at length, being tir'd with the War, and fearing
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:135663:130"/> his Perſon fatal to the Places he enter'd, he quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Flanders,</hi> leaving ſeveral brave Boys there, who would in time make good Souldiers for the King, and was return'd to <hi>Madrid:</hi> He added, that he paſs'd homeward through <hi>France,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd that Kingdom to be ſo full of People, and the Villages ſo near one another, that he thought he had travell'd two hundred Leagues all in one Town, which appear'd to him very extraordinary, who had been us'd to travel five and twenty, or thirty Leagues in <hi>Spain,</hi> without ſeeing a Houſe, unleſs it were ſome pitiful <hi>Venta,</hi> or ſorry Inn: And having conſider'd with himſelf that the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of <hi>Spain</hi> proceeded from its being ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart, he was willing, what in him lay, to repair that defect, by marrying again: But two of the Wives he had left in <hi>Flanders</hi> having follow'd him to <hi>Madrid,</hi> and found him at home with his Wife, it anger'd them ſo grievouſly, that they had recourſe to Juſtice, and charg'd him with ſeveral other miſdemeanors and impieties: that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition taking Cognizance of his Crimes had clapt him up in Priſon, and kept him there, though in all he had done, he had no other end but the Service of his King, and glory of his Country. The Princeſs could not forbear laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s Relation, which gave her ſo true a Character of a <hi>Spaniard;</hi> it being certain there is nothing ſo conceitedly haughty, as a
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Souldier at his return into <hi>Spain,</hi> from the Army in <hi>Flanders:</hi> he thinks himſelf the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Man that hath preſerv'd the State, and that now he may be allow'd to follow his inclinations, and take his Pleaſure without puniſhment, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:135663:130"/>As ſoon as our <hi>Heroine</hi> was alone, ſhe fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her former fit of melancholy, as if ſhe had preſag'd what was a driving on againſt her in
<hi>Flanders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Marqueſs <hi>D'Oſſeyra</hi> knew nothing of his Miſtreſs being gone into
<hi>Spain,</hi> but thought her ſtill in the Covent at <hi>Mons;</hi> the Ducheſs of
<hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchot</hi> having taken care to keep him in that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, by writing often to him under pretence of ſending him news of <hi>Chriſtina:</hi> She advis'd him ſtill not to be too haſty, and a little patience would certainly make him happy. But the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs had other deſigns: the intereſt of her Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and her particular dependences on <hi>Spain,</hi> made her reſolve to have her Niece married to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of that Nation. This Niece of hers had not yet appear'd abroad, but was bred in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; all the knowledge they had of her, was that ſhe was very handſome, and a very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Fortune. The Quality and Merit of the Marqueſs
<hi>D'Oſſeyra,</hi> made the Ducheſs think him a fit Match for her Niece. In order to this, ſhe was willing to endeavour curing him of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> being fully perſwaded the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Birth and Eſtate of her Niece, would be ſufficient to accompliſh her deſign within a ſhort time after her appearing at Court. But having obſerv'd by the Marqueſſes Letters, the conſtancy of his affection for <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> the Ducheſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair'd of ſucceſs, and reſpited the ſending her Niece to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> for fear her Charms ſhould have, upon ſome leſs intereſs'd Perſon, the effect ſhe deſir'd they ſhould work on the Marqueſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. About that time it was <hi>French</hi> took S.
<hi>Giſlain:</hi> the Ducheſs fearing, from the ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:135663:131"/> of the Place, <hi>Mons</hi> in the Spring might have the like Forune, which would break all her Meaſures, and make it too late to execute her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; ſhe reſolv'd to go to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate her intentions to the Ducheſs <hi>de Villa Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> who was very well pleas'd with the zeal ſhe expreſt for the
<hi>Spaniards.</hi> Divers means were propos'd to aſſure the ſucceſs of the Marriage, but all appearing uncertain, or dilatory, they part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without coming to any reſolution. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>D'Oſſeyra</hi> went every Day to ſee the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs <hi>d' Arſcot,</hi> who, very deſirous to penetrate his ſentiments, after a great deal of Diſcourſe, by the by, advertis'd him, as his Friend, that <hi>Chriſtina</hi> had in confidence acquainted her with her deſign of making her ſelf a Nun; but if it ſhould be ſo, he might be otherwiſe provided of a Miſtreſs, to ſupply the loſs of this. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs was much alarm'd at
<hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s reſolution, and intreated the Ducheſs to give it all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction ſhe could, which ſhe promis'd very frankly. Having given the Ducheſs <hi>de Villa Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſa</hi> an account of this Diſcourſe, ſhe found her no leſs than her ſelf at a loſs what courſe to take: But at laſt, ſeeing themſelves ſtraiten'd in time, the report of his Chriſtian Majeſty leaving <hi>Paris</hi> in few Days being ſpread all about, they agreed that the Ducheſs ſhould adviſe the Marqueſs to ſteal his Miſtreſs out of the Covent, and marry her as ſoon as he could get her out. They thought this a very probable way to effect the Deſign, becauſe the Ducheſs might eaſily deceive him, in ſubſtituting her Niece in the Place of <hi>Chriſtina.</hi> The Ducheſs of <hi>Arſcot</hi> would not hear of it, as a thing unworthy a Perſon of her Quality to uſe
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:135663:131"/> any Artifice to make a <hi>Spaniard</hi> marry her Niece; but at length her ambition, and the flatteries of the Ducheſs <hi>de Villa Hermoſa,</hi> prevail'd with her to reject all theſe conſiderations; not doubting, with her dextrous addreſs, ſhe might trap the Marqueſs; and that the Beauty of her Niece, and reſpect due to her Birth, would ſtop his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of a Cheat put upon him ſo much to his advantage. Soon after this delicate Project, the Marqueſs came to the Ducheſs of <hi>Arſcot</hi>'s: The ordinary expreſſions of civility were ſcarce over, but ſhe told him, with ſome concern, that Word was ſent her from
<hi>Mons, Chriſtina</hi> was every Day more and more reſolved to take the Nuns Habit, and that ſhe durſt no longer undertake, but ſhe would ſuddenly do it. The Marqueſs anſwer'd her, it would break his Heart; and conjur'd her not to forſake him, but uſe all her intereſt with
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> to divert her from this reſolution. To what purpoſe, ſays the Ducheſs; for neither the King, nor your Relations will ever give way to your marrying a Stranger that has no Fortune, is but of mean Birth, and (as vertuous as I take her for) hath occaſion'd very different judgments of her: To diſabuſe you, 'tis my opinion you ſhould no longer oppoſe her deſign of turning Nun, it will be more for your Reputation than you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of, and this Action alone will juſtifie all the reſt of her Life. The Marqueſs confeſs'd ſhe had Reaſon of her ſide, but that the violence of his Love would not let him yield to it; that he would make himſelf happy to his own ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, without troubling himſelf what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thought of it, as being not of their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment who think a Mans happineſs depends on the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:135663:132"/> opinion others have of it. Since you are of that Mind, ſays the Ducheſs, I will let you ſee how true a Friend I am to you, in doing you a Piece of Service more conſiderable than you could have hop'd for, and ſuch as ſhall make you happy all the Days of your Life. The Marqueſs aſſur'd her he ſhould ever acknowledge her Favours, and promis'd to do whatever ſhe advis'd him to. You muſt then, replys the Ducheſs, ſteal her out of the Covent, and I will undertake ſhe ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to it; for her deſire of turning Nun proceeds only from her fear that you have forgot her. And as all Women are very ſenſible of being ſlighted, ſhe is glad of amuſing the World, by giving out ſhe will ſpend her Life in a Cloyſter, though it be in truth only to ſave her Credit, in caſe you ſhould not love her: And that you may be no longer expos'd to the Freaks of Fortune, or the Violences of the Duke
<hi>de Villa Hermoſa,</hi> my Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner ſhall marry you in my Chappel, as ſoon as you have got her out of the Covent. The Marqueſs, over-joy'd at a Project that ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly flatter'd his Paſſion, threw himſelf at her Feet, not having the Power to anſwer her a word, but his dumb Eloquence expreſs'd his Mind clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough: They agreed how all things ſhould be carry'd, and the Ducheſs on the Morrow went for <hi>Mons,</hi> to diſpoſe things for Execution of the Deſign.</p>
                  <p>She told her Niece ſhe had made Choice of a Husband for her, with whom ſhe ſhould have abundant Cauſe to be ſatisfy'd; but that there were invincible Reaſons to oblige her to permit her ſelf to be ſtollen out of the Covent, and be marry'd without Ceremony; adding, ſhe was not to be
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:135663:132"/> ſurpriz'd at it, as being all for her Advantage. The young Lady, who in the whole Courſe of her Breeding had been taught to pay the Ducheſs very great Reſpects, ſubmitted her ſelf wholly to her Pleaſure. The Ducheſs having made ſure of her Niece, and all others ſhe had uſe of, writ to the Marqueſs <hi>d'Oſſeyra,</hi> to let him know all was in readineſs; and that he had no more to do but come the next Night to <hi>Mons,</hi> with two of his truſtieſt Domeſticks, and that he might come to her Houſe, where ſhe would tell him how the buſineſs ſhould be managed. The Marqueſs, who waited with Impatience for News from the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs, fail'd not to ſet out the Hour ſhe appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He arriv'd at
<hi>Mons,</hi> and went to the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſes, as had been agreed on. You ſee, ſays ſhe, what I expoſe my ſelf to for your ſake: But that you may not be blam'd for this Action, I think it very fit you ſhould write to the Duke <hi>de Villa Hermoſa,</hi> to let him know you are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd; and intreat him, that ſince 'tis a done thing, that he will write into <hi>Spain,</hi> in your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that the Court may agree to it: I will take care your Letter ſhall be deliver'd him, and ſend him word the ſame time, I have had no hand in your buſineſs. The Marqueſs conſented to all ſhe deſir'd, but had his Head ſo full of Love, he would never have been able to finiſh his Letter without the Ducheſſes help, who made him write what ſhe pleas'd, without naming <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> with deſign to take her advantage by that Letter to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie her ſelf to the World, as if the Marqueſs had indeavou'd to ſteal away her Niece, and that he might be forc'd to marry her, if the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in Hand ſhould unexpectedly miſcarry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:135663:133"/>All things thus order'd, ſhe forgot not any thing that might heighten the Beauty of her Niece. It was no hard matter to ſet off a young Lady, whom Nature had made very handſome and amiable: The Ducheſs having viſited her a little afore Night, gave her new inſtructions for her dreſs, and deportment, and return'd very well ſatisfy'd with her Charms. She appointed her to be at the Covent-Garden Gate, with a Maid who was of the Plot, and to follow the Gentleman who came in ſearch of them: She charg'd her by any means not to ſpeak, to cover her ſelf with a great Vail, and not ſhew her Face, till the Prieſt had finiſh'd the Ceremony; telling her, it was no more than in decency was requiſite, to ſatisfie the Gentleman, and the Company, of her modeſty. The Ducheſs being return'd home, told the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs all thing were order'd as he could wiſh. At laſt, the Night ſo much deſir'd by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, and perhaps by the Lady as earneſtly long'd for, was come; the amorous <hi>Spaniard,</hi> full of good intentions, and led by his paſſion, enter'd the Garden through a Door, of which they had given him a Key for the purpoſe. He found there two Perſons vail'd, one whereof was about the height of <hi>Chriſtina:</hi> Having approach'd, with a reſpect not free from fear, he took her by the Hand, and led her to the Ducheſſes with the haſte you may imagine. They went ſtraight to the Chappel, where the Prieſt waited their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The Marqueſs fell preſently at the Feet of her he thought his Miſtreſs, to thank her for her goodneſs, and began to ſay ſuch things as love inſpires a Man in his condition withall: But the Ducheſs haſten'd the Prieſt to do his Office, and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:135663:133"/> ſaid to the Marqueſs, he was not to loſe time in Fruitleſs Diſcourſe, to keep his Miſtreſs from the Pleaſure ſhe propos'd to her ſelf, in being at liberty to look upon him, without wronging her modeſty. The Marqueſs having his Head full of the thoughts of <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> fancy'd he ſaw her, without ſhewing her Face: He was ſatisfy'd with a Kiſs of her Hand, fell on his Knees, and was married. The Ceremony was ſcarce ended, but the Marqueſs cry'd out, he was the Happieſt Man alive, ſince it was not in the Power of his Enemies to prevent his being united to the moſt amiable Perſon in the World. Yes, and more happy than you are aware of, replys the Ducheſs throwing off the Brides Vail, ſince in marrying you to my Niece, who might be the Darling of the beſt Man on Earth, I have marry'd you to a Lady of great Birth, and a conſiderable Fortune. The Marqueſs was ſo troubled at the Diſcourſe of the Ducheſs, and the ſurprizing Beauty of her Niece, that for ſome time he ſtood mute. Your Relations, and Friends, have agreed to this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, continues the Ducheſs; and nothing but a Merit equal to yours could have prevail'd with me to have a Hand in a Trick of this kind, to make you happy againſt your will. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs was ſo agitated with different motions, he could not anſwer a Word, needing all the reſpect thoſe of his Nation have for Perſons of the beſt Quality, to keep him from breaking out into out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage againſt the Ducheſs. She was about to ſpeak to him of the advantages of this Affair. Madam, ſays the Marqueſs, interrupting her, I pray in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult not over my grief; for I know not whether I ſhall be able to take it at your Hands. This was
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:135663:134"/> but one of thoſe expreſſions of ſorrow and regret he let fall, which forc'd Tears from the new Marchioneſs, who had not any Hand in her Aunts Cheat, and expected Complements from her Husband of a very different Nature. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs mov'd at her Tears, and wounded to the Heart with his own Sorrows, went into another Room, and would have left the Houſe with a Reſolution to go whitherſoever deſpair would lead him: But the Ducheſs, who fearing the Noiſe this Buſineſs might make, had the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, and Care, to make ſure of an Order from the Duke <hi>de Villa Hermoſa</hi> to arreſt the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs; had it put in execution, by Perſons who waited at the Gate for that purpoſe. He was ſo diſorder'd, he ſcarce knew he was arreſted. An Officer, his Friend, whom the Ducheſs ſent for to ſpeak with him, endeavour'd to perſwade him to be ſatisfy'd, but without effect. The Marqueſs paſs'd all the Night in very gret diſquiet: the morrow the Duke <hi>de Villa Hermoſa</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Mons,</hi> where he had long Diſcourſe with the Marqueſs; I know not the particulars, but 'tis probable he ſhew'd him the advantages of this Marriage, and the neceſſity lay upon him to make no more ſtir about the Buſineſs: which if he did, he would be laugh'd at, and provoke the Court, his Friends, and the Ducheſſes Family all againſt him. The Marqueſs convinc'd with theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſeeing there was no Remedy, ſubmitted to the advice of the Duke <hi>de Villa Hermoſa;</hi> and thought it beſt to return to his Wife, and beg her Pardon for what was paſt. But ſhe would not hear him, being reſolv'd to pay him in the Coyn ſhe had receiv'd from him, and avoid his
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:135663:134"/> company who had ſo much ſlighted her. The Ducheſs found all her Authority over her Niece, little enough to retain her: She would not afford an Ear to any thing could be ſaid for him, who had expreſt himſelf ſorry he had marry'd her.</p>
                  <p>A beautiful Lady hath great Advantages, her Complaints are moving, her Reproaches wound to the quick, and her Tears find Compaſſion in the ſtonieſt Heart. The Marqueſs, who had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd his Lady with a great deal of Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, was ſo ſenſible of her Complaints, her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and Tears, that he fell on his Knees, proteſting the Crime ſhe thought him guilty of, a pure effect of his Aſtoniſhment; and that if ſhe would vouchſafe him the hearing, he could eaſily clear himſelf. She caſt her Eyes upon him, without anſwering a Word; her Looks, and the Difficulty ſhe made of being appeas'd, heighten'd in the Marqueſs the Deſire of Reconciliation: He made her ſo many Preteſtations, and aſſur'd her he would love her eternally, that at laſt ſhe yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Inſtances of the Ducheſs, or rather the Oaths of the Marqueſs; But upon Condition he would give her a true Account what had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd him to expreſs himſelf troubled for having marry'd her, and to abſent himſelf as he had done. The Marqueſs promis'd it, but whether he kept his Word I know not, having not been able to learn the Particulars of the Account he gave her, which laſted all Night; but 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry likely ſhe was very well ſatisfy'd, having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver complain'd of it ſince: The Marqueſs about a Week after brought her to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie himſelf to thoſe who were acquainted with his Paſſion for <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> ſaid, It was not in his
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:135663:135"/> Power to reſiſt the Decrees of Heaven, where his Marriage had been appointed many Ages ago.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Chriſtina</hi> had not heard of this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, the News of it having not yet reach'd <hi>Spain;</hi> 'tis certain her Heart miſgave her ſome Ill was towards her, which caſt her frequently into Melancholy the Princeſs had much ado to perſwade her from, by telling her ſhe was not to afflict her ſelf before-hand, by fancying ſhe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw the unfaithfulneſs of her Lover. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> confeſs'd her ſelf to blame for't, but could not help it.</p>
                  <p>Hearing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Envoy was returning for <hi>London,</hi> ſhe acquainted the Princeſs with the great Deſire ſhe had to lay hold on that accaſion to leave
<hi>Spain,</hi> and go to the Marqueſs <hi>d'Oſſeyra.</hi> The Princeſs gave many good Reaſons to divert her from this Reſolution, but in vain; <hi>Chriſtina</hi> acknowledging the force of her Reaſons, but that it was not in her Power to yield to them, and that ſhe ſhould certainly have the Diſpleaſure to ſee her die with Deſpair, if ſhe oppos'd her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign any longer. Loth as the Princeſs was to part with our <hi>Heroine,</hi> ſhe was however forc'd to let her go, to prevent the mortal Effects of her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair: She gave her a Letter of Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Envoy, intreating his Care of that young <hi>Spaniſh Gontleman,</hi> being a Perſon of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Merit, and very deſirous to go with him into <hi>England.</hi> The Princeſs gave her ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Letters, in her favour, addreſs'd to Perſons in good Credit in the Court of His Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain. Chriſtina</hi> having reſumed her Man's Habit, and the Day of her Departure hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Foot-boy, overtook the Envoy two
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:135663:135"/> Days Journey from <hi>Madrid,</hi> not having ventur'd to go out of Town with him, for fear of being ſtaid, if diſcover'd. The Envoy receiv'd her very courteouſly, eaſily believing the good Character the Princeſs gave in her Letter to him of young
<hi>Montalban</hi> (as ſhe call'd him) who confirm'd by his Meen, and Diſcourſe, the good Opinion the Envoy had of him at firſt Sight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Montalban</hi> was ſo pleas'd with the thought the ſhould ſhortly have a better opportunity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming himſelf truly of the ſtate of his Love Concerns, that he appear'd very chearful and aye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which the Envoy was much taken with, but could not let him know it for want of skill in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Language, which he could not ſpeak, though he underſtood it very well. <hi>Montalban</hi> pretended he had no other Language, but that he had a ſmall inſight in the <hi>French,</hi> yet not ſo much as to ſpeak it. The Envoy, who had been bred in <hi>France,</hi> was glad of that, and from thenceforth ſpoke to him always in
<hi>French,</hi> which <hi>Montalban</hi> anſwer'd in <hi>Spaniſh.</hi> He maintain'd this Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter very well, till one Day the Envoy obſerving him in a deep Study, ask'd him if he had left a Miſtreſs behind him at <hi>Madrid. Montalban</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Head full of Love, and ſurpriz'd with the Queſtion, anſwer'd him in <hi>French,</hi> He had not a Miſtreſs in the World; and continued ſpeaking in that Language, till he perceiv'd the Envoy aſtoniſh'd at it: Whereupon, making uſe of that readineſs of Wit which had done him ſo good Service on former occaſions, and few Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men want, he fell a laughing at the Envoy's Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, and pray'd him, in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> to tell him truly if he had ſpoken good <hi>French.</hi> The Envoy
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:135663:136"/> aſſur'd him, a natural <hi>French-man</hi> could not have ſpoke better. In troth, replies <hi>Montalban,</hi> I thought the Princeſs had but jeſted, when, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taught me thoſe three or four words, ſhe told me I pronounc'd them very well: I will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my ſelf to learn <hi>French,</hi> as ſoon as I come to <hi>London.</hi> You will infallibly attain it, ſays the Envoy, you are ſo naturally fitted for it. Our <hi>Heroine</hi> having, by her Wit, retriev'd the Fault her Diſtraction made her fall into, avoided care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully all occaſions of letting him perceive ſhe could ſpeak <hi>French,</hi> the better to maintain the part ſhe deſign'd to act in <hi>England.</hi> Being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at <hi>London, Montalban</hi> deliver'd a Letter from the Princeſs, to the Marqueſs <hi>Bargamanero,</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy extraordinary from <hi>Spain.</hi> The Marqueſs being an <hi>Italian</hi> born, doubted not but the young <hi>Spaniard</hi> was very well deſcended, as the Princeſs had ſignify'd by her Letter: He us'd him with all the civility imaginable, praying him to accept of an Apartment in his Houſe; for, beſides the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect due to the recommendation of the Princeſs, an
<hi>Italian,</hi> or <hi>Flemming,</hi> employ'd in the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Service, is glad of any occaſion to oblige a natural <hi>Spaniard,</hi> to take off the jealouſie and umbrage they have of Strangers employ'd in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of that Crown. <hi>Montalban</hi> would not lodge at the Marqueſſes, but Din'd there every Day, and went often to Court with him, where he was kindly receiv'd by thoſe who eſpous'd the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of <hi>Spain:</hi> this was of incredible advantage to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> who were us'd to ſee thoſe of that Nation haughty and huffiſh, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the civility and good Meen of <hi>Montalban.</hi> But he could not be ſatisfy'd with the Care the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:135663:136"/> Marqueſs took to divert him, nor the civilities he receiv'd from ſeveral
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Courtiers, ſuch was his impatience to know how things went in
<hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:</hi> He ask'd every one, what News from thence, and was told of the Preparations made for the Campaign, the provident Care of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Governour for the Places moſt in danger to be attack'd, and many other particulars <hi>Montal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> was not concern'd in, nor car'd for: But not a Word of the Marqueſs <hi>D'Oſſeyra,</hi> nor durſt he enquire after him, in particular, leſt his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſhould betray him, and diſcover the Reaſon of his Curioſity that way. His Heart miſgave him ſtill, and continued the alarms and preſages of ill ſucceſs to his Love, which ſo haunted his Thoughts he could not reliſh any Pleaſure, though frequently invited to partake of it. Sometimes he reſolv'd for
<hi>Bruſſels,</hi> to know how things ſtood; the next moment he diſcover'd Reaſons to divert him from that deſign. Tormented with this inquietude, and not able to reſolve what courſe to take, but inclining to continue in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, which left him ſome poor hopes of the conſtancy of the Marqueſs <hi>D'Oſſeyra,</hi> rather than hazard the diſcovery of a truth which might plunge him in deſpair. As he was at Dinner at the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Envoys, a Gentleman of <hi>Flanders,</hi> newly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> came in to ſalute the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>Borgamanero,</hi> and deliver'd him Letters from the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> The Marqueſs having known the Gentleman by Name, receiv'd him very civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and made him ſit at Table with him. When the <hi>Flemming</hi> had drank the Healths of all the Beauties of
<hi>Bruſſels,</hi> his Tongue began to run, and he gave them ſeveral Pieces of choice News
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:135663:137"/> from <hi>Flanders,</hi> adding ſome Gallantries of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Generals the Winter paſt; and, interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf, now that I am fallen upon the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Gallantry, Have you not heard, ſays he, of the officious Cheat put upon the Marqueſs <hi>D'Oſſeyra,</hi> to cure him of the violent Paſſion he had for a
<hi>French-woman.</hi> Had any one then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd <hi>Montalban</hi>'s Countenance, he might have eaſily diſcover'd the Trouble he was in: But they were all attentive to the <hi>Flemmiſh</hi> Gentlemans Diſcourſe, who told them, the Ducheſs of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchot,</hi> by Agreement with the Duke <hi>de Villa Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſa,</hi> on pretence of Favouring the Marqueſs <hi>De Oſſeyra</hi>'s Marriage with the <hi>French-woman,</hi> had marry'd her Niece to him. Oh Heavens, cry'd <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> no more minding the Name, or Nation ſhe pretended to, and fell off of her Stool. The Company thought it ſome Diſeaſe, or Infirmity, and every one ſtrove to help her, attributing the Exclamation to the violence of the Diſtemper, and not dreaming in the leaſt of the true Cauſe of the Acident. The Envoy of <hi>Spain</hi> was the moſt alarm'd at it, fearing, in a time where poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings are ſo ordinary, it might be thought this <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gentleman had been poyſoned at his Houſe.</p>
                  <p>Could one have dy'd of violent grief, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded our <hi>Heroine</hi> had taken her leave of this World, upon hearing the Gentlemans News: but a Death of that kind happens not in our Age, and ſhe, by the Marqueſſes Care, recover'd her ſtrength pretty well, and was carry'd into her Chamber, where, intending to give free vent to thoſe paſſions the ill news had occaſion'd, ſhe had the dexterity to get rid of the importunate Care
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:135663:137"/> of thoſe who accompany'd her, by telling them ſhe was often ſubject to Infirmities of that kind, and had learnt by experience that reſt was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and infallible Cure. As ſoon as ſhe was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, ſhe burſt out into Tears, and her Fancy, to her further Torment, repreſented to her a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand unpleaſant things to increaſe her grief, which was ſwell'd to that height the moſt cruel Death would have been welcom. After much debate with her ſelf, ſhe thought it fit for her to return into her Country, and ſpend there the reſt of her Days in a Cloyſter, her Vertue ſuggeſting to her ſhe was oblig'd to make the World this Amends for all the innocent ſcandals ſhe had given it.</p>
                  <p>Upon the News of the Accident at the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Envoys, the pretended <hi>Montalban</hi> was viſited by ſeveral Perſons of the beſt Quality: The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had brought the News of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>D'Oſſeyra</hi>'s being marry'd, thought himſelf oblig'd in civility to give him a viſit. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> (or, if you will, <hi>Montalban</hi>) was a-bed when this Gentleman came to his Lodging: <hi>Montalban</hi> gave order he ſhould come in, and the ordinary civilities being over, told him he was ſorry his Infirmity had depriv'd him of hearing the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of the Marqueſs <hi>D'Oſſeyra</hi>'s Marriage: The Gentleman offer'd to make him the Relation; <hi>Montalban</hi> anſwering, he would much oblige him in it, the Gentleman acquainted him with all the Circumſtances of the Affair, without perceiving the change it produc'd in our <hi>Heroine</hi>'s Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, who had (to prevent his diſcovery) drawn her Bed-Curtain that ſhe might not be ſeen. The <hi>Flemming</hi> being retir'd,
<hi>Chriſtina</hi> fell again into Tears, yet without any murmuring againſt the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:135663:138"/> Marqueſs <hi>D'Oſſeyra,</hi> whom ſhe could not accuſe of infidelity. As ſtrongly as ſhe labour'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm her Reſolution of going into a Monaſtery, ſhe found within her no ſmall reluctancy againſt the putting it in execution: ſo hard a Task was it to diſengage her ſelf from the inclinations ſhe had for a Perſon ſhe had lov'd ſo entirely, and eſteem'd ſo worthy of her affection: After much ſtrugling and ſtriving with her ſelf, ſhe reſolv'd to ſend him a Letter, which was written as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

Had you been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful for the affection I bore you, the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of your unfaithfulneſs would have, in ſome Meaſure, allay'd my ſenſe of the loſs of you: But while I adore you, and you love me, another enjoys you.

                     <hi>Chriſtina</hi> having heard that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Envoy ſent a Gentleman with Letters into <hi>Flanders,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd him to deliver this to the Marqueſs
<hi>D'Oſſey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> and tell him, the Party who ſent it expected not his anſwer. Our
<hi>Heroine</hi> having written this Letter, found her ſelf ſomewhat better at eaſe; ſhe weigh'd the deſign ſhe had of entring a Covent, and found it in truth a courſe of Life wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable to her Humour: She conſider'd how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny made their Lives unhappy by embracing a Profeſſion out of deſpair, or to Pleaſe their Friends, or for other like Reaſons contrary to their Inclinations: She choſe rather to ſeek out an opportunity to periſh gloriouſly in the Wars, than to languiſh many Years in an unhappy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, not doubting but the thoughts of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Marqueſs would Haunt her in the moſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate retirements. This made her throw off the relicks of weakneſs her Sex had left her, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard that his Majeſty of
<hi>France</hi> had open'd the Campaign by the Conqueſt of <hi>Ghent,</hi> ſhe continued her diſguiſe, and went into the Army with two or three <hi>Engliſh</hi> Volunteers, who went to learn the Rudiments of War under that great Maſter. The Town of <hi>Ypers</hi> being beſieg'd about that time, our <hi>Heroine,</hi> to avoid meeting with thoſe who might probably know her, during her long abode formerly there, conſulted rather the motions of deſpair, than endeavour'd to ſignalize her ſelf by Actions of extraordinary valour: She mingled her ſelf one Day with a Detachment of the Regiments of the King's Houſhold, who with Sword in Hand took a Half-moon, where <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina</hi> receiv'd a Muſquet-ſhot, and was carry'd to her Tent. The Chyrurgeons, leſs Complaiſant in
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:135663:139"/> the Army than elſewhere, judg'd her Wound mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal: The <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who came with her from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and ſtill thought the pretended Gentleman a
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> fancy'd he had receiv'd the Wound by endeavouring to put himſelf into the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Service, by getting into the Town: This made them acquaint the Marqueſs <hi>de Conflans</hi> with what had paſt. He was Governour of the Place, and having Captitulated that very Day to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> let him know there was in the Camp, a young Gentleman, a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> call'd <hi>Montalban,</hi> who was wounded with a Muſquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot, by endeavouring to get into the Town. The Marqueſs, well acquainted with the name, thought he might be one of the Noble Family of <hi>Montalban,</hi> the Head whereof is the now Duke of
<hi>Uceda,</hi> and diſpatch'd a Collonel of the Gariſon to enquire of his Health, and ſee if he were in a condition to be carry'd to <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> accompany d the Collonel, and told our <hi>Heroine</hi> they had inform'd the Governour of <hi>Ypres</hi> of his Quality, and Hurt; and that he had ſent thither this Collonel, to know if he would be carry'd to <hi>Bruſſels. Chriſtina,</hi> amaz'd at the Diſcourſe, was pleas'd however at ſo good an occaſion of going to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> in hopes to ſee the Marqueſs <hi>D' Oſſey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> before ſhe dy'd: She confirm'd them in their errour, and having anſwer'd the Collonel's civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as well as the condition ſhe was in would permit her, ſhe pray'd him to tell the Marqueſs of <hi>Conflans,</hi> he would do him a ſingular Favour to convey him to
<hi>Bruſſels,</hi> which was according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done. Soon after her Arrival there, the Marqueſs of
<hi>Conflans</hi> inform'd the Court, he had brought thither a young Gentleman of <hi>Spain,</hi> who was
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:135663:139"/> lately come out of <hi>England</hi> to throw himſelf into <hi>Ypres,</hi> but was unfortunately prevented by a Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet-ſhot, receiv'd as he was endeavouring to get into the Town. The Perſons of the greateſt Quality at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> fearing to incommode
<hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talban</hi> with their viſits, ſent to enquire of his Health: But he fell into a Fever, and no hopes of Cure. All thoſe about him wonder'd at the Care he took to enquire who the were who ſent to know how he did, which proceeded from the deſire the ſuppoſed
<hi>Montalban</hi> had to hear the Marqueſs <hi>D' Oſſeyra</hi> nam'd for one. At laſt he was told that this Marqueſs, being newly return'd from <hi>Bruges,</hi> had ſent a Gentleman to enquire of his Health. <hi>Montalban</hi> was ſo glad of it, that thoſe who attended him obſerv'd a vaiſible Change in his looks: Having fetch'd two or three ſighs, he ſaid, he ſhould be very glad to ſee the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, having ſomething of Conſequence to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to him. The Marqueſs being inform'd of it, ran to him immediately, fancying him to be a Gentleman of the Houſe of <hi>Montalban,</hi> who had been of his acquaintance in <hi>Spain.</hi> As the Marqueſs enter'd the Room, they told him the Gentleman was ſpeechleſs. The Marqueſs went haſtily up to the Bed, and looking ſtedfaſtly on the Perſon that lay there, knew her to be his <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> a dying: She reacht forth her Arm, and taking him by the Hand, made him ſenſible of the ſatisfaction ſhe had, to ſee him before ſhe dy'd. The tragick Spectacle ſo affected the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, he was ready to fall down dead for Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: He continued many Days retir'd in a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Houſe, and incapable of comfort for being the cauſe of our
<hi>Heroine</hi>'s Death, he reſolv'd to quit
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:135663:140"/> that Country where a hundred Objects would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Day repreſent to his memory, the Death of <hi>Chriſtina:</hi> He made uſe of his Friends to procure him Employment elſe-where, and in a ſhort time after receiv'd Orders from <hi>Spain</hi> to go and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in

                     <hi>AUrelian</hi> was the only Son to a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Gentleman of <hi>Florence.</hi> The Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of his Father prompted, and his Wealth enabled him, to beſtow a generous Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation upon him, whom, he now began to look upon as the Type of himſelf; an Impreſſion he had made in the Gayety and Vigour of his Youth, before the Ruſt of Age had debilitated and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcur'd the Splendor of the Original: He was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, That he ought not to be ſparing in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dornment of him, if he had Reſolution to beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his own Momory. Indeed <hi>Don Fabio</hi> (for ſo was the Old Gentleman call'd) has been obſerv'd to have fix'd his Eyes upon <hi>Aurelian,</hi> when much Company has been at Table, and have wept through Earneſtneſs of Intention, if nothing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to divert the Object; whether it were for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, at the Recollection of his former ſelf, or for the Joy he conceiv'd in being, as it were, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd in the Perſon of his Son, I never took upon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:135663:143"/> me to enquire, but ſuppos'd it might be ſomtimes one, and ſomtimes both together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aurelian,</hi> at the Age of Eighteen Years, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing (but a Beard) that the moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed <hi>Cavalier</hi> in <hi>Florence</hi> could pretend to: he had been Educated from Twelve Years old at <hi>Siena,</hi> where it ſeems his Father kept a Receiver, having a large Income from the Rents of ſeveral Houſes in that Town. <hi>Don Fabio</hi> gave his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Orders, That <hi>Aurelian</hi> ſhould not be ſtinted in his Expences, when he came up to Years of Diſcretion. By which means he was enabled, not only to keep Company with, but alſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer many Obligations upon Strangers of Quality, and Gentlemen who travelled from other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries into <hi>Italy,</hi> of which <hi>Siena</hi> never wanted ſtore, being a Town moſt delightfully Situate, upon a Noble Hill, and very well ſuiting with Strangers at firſt, by reaſon of the agreeableneſs and purity of the Air: There alſo is the quaintneſs and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the <hi>Italian</hi> Tongue moſt likely to be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there being many publick Profeſſors of it in that place, and indeed the very Vulgar of <hi>Siena</hi> do expreſs themſelves with an eaſineſs and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſurprizing, and even grateful to their Ears who underſtand not the Language.</p>
                  <p>Here <hi>Aurelian</hi> contracted an acquaintance with Perſons of Worth of ſeveral Countries, but among the reſt an intimacy with a Gentleman of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Nephew to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> who had ſo wrought himſelf into the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> through a Conformity of Temper, an Equality in Years, and ſomething of reſemblance in Feature and Proportion, that he look'd upon him as his ſecond ſelf.
<hi>Hippolito,</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:135663:143"/> on the other hand, was not ungrateful in return of Friendſhip, but thought himſelf either alone or in ill Company, if <hi>Aurelian</hi> were abſent: but his Uncle having ſent him to travel, under the Conduct of a Governour, and the two Years which limited his ſtay at <hi>Siena</hi> being expired, he was put in mind of his departure.</p>
                  <p>His Friend grew melancholy at the News, but conſidering that <hi>Hippolito</hi> had never ſeen <hi>Florence,</hi> he eaſily prevailed with him to make his firſt Journey thither, whither he would accompany him, and perhaps prevail with his Father to do the like throughout his Travels.</p>
                  <p>They accordingly ſet out, but not being able eaſily to reach <hi>Florence</hi> the ſame Night, they reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a League or two ſhort, at a <hi>Villa</hi> of the great Duke's called
<hi>Poggio Imperiale,</hi> where they were informed by ſome of his Highneſs's Servants, That the Nuptials of <hi>Donna Catharina</hi> (near Kinſwoman to the great Duke) and <hi>Don Ferdinand de Rovori,</hi> were to be ſolemnized the next day, and that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Preparations had been making for ſome time paſt, to illuſtrate the Solemnity with Balls and Maſques, and other Divertiſements; that a Tilting had been proclaimed, and to that purpoſe Scaffolds erected around the Spacious Court, before the Church <hi>Di Sante Croce,</hi> where were uſually ſeen all Cavalcades and Shews, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Aſſemblies of the Young Nobility: That all Mechanicks and Tradeſmen were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to work, or expoſe any Goods to Sale for the ſpace of three days; during which time all Perſons ſhould be entertain'd at the Great Duke's Coſt; and publick Proviſion was to be made for the ſetting forth and furniſhing a multitude of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:135663:144"/> Tables, with Entertainment for all Comers and Goers, and ſeveral Houſes appointed for that uſe in all Streets.</p>
                  <p>This Account alarm'd the Spirits of our Young Travellers, and they were overjoy'd at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Pleaſures they foreſaw. <hi>Aurelian</hi> could not contain the ſatisfaction he conceiv'd in the welcome Fortune had prepar'd for his dear <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito.</hi> In ſhort, they both remembred ſo much of the pleaſing Relation had been made them, that they forgot to ſleep, and were up as ſoon as it was light, pounding at poor Signior <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio</hi>'s Door (ſo was <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Governour call'd) to rouſe him, that no time might be loſt till they were arriv'd at <hi>Florence,</hi> where they would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh themſelves with Diſguiſes and other Accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trements neceſſary for the Proſecution of their Deſign of ſharing in the publick Merriment; the rather were they for going ſo early, becauſe <hi>Aurelian</hi> did not think fit to publiſh his being in Town for a time, leſt his Father knowing of it, might give ſome reſtraint to that looſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Before Sun riſe they entred <hi>Florence</hi> at <hi>Porta Romana,</hi> attended only by two Servants, the reſt being left behind to avoid notice; but, alas! they needed not to have uſed half that caution; for early as it was, the Streets were crowded with all ſorts of People paſſing to and fro, and every Man employ'd in ſomething relating to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions to come; ſo that no notice was taken of any body; a Marqueſs and his Train might have paſs'd by as unregarded as a ſingle Fachin or Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. Not a Window in the Streets but echoed the tuning of a Lute or thrumming of a Gitarr: for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:135663:144"/> by the way, the Inhabitants of <hi>Florence</hi> are ſtrangely addicted to the love of Muſick, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that ſcarce their Children can go, before they can ſcratch ſome Inſtrument or other. It was no unpleaſing Spectacle to our Cavaliers (who, ſeeing they were not obſerv'd, reſolv'd to make Obſervations) to behold the Diverſity of Figures and Poſtures of many of theſe Muſicians. Here you ſhould have an affected Vallet, who, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick'd the Behaviour of his Maſter, leaning care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly againſt the Window, with his Head on one ſide, in a languiſhing Poſture, whining, in a low, mournful Voice, ſome diſmal Complaint; while, from his ſympathizing <hi>Theorbo,</hi> iſſued a Baſe no leſs doleful to the Hearers. In Oppoſition to him was ſet up perhaps a Cobler, with the wretched Skeleton of a Gitarr, battered and waxed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his own Induſtry, and who with three Strings out of Tune, and his own tearing hoarſe Voice, would rack attention from the Neigbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to the great affliction of many more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Practitioners, who, no doubt, were full as deſirous to be heard. By this time <hi>Aurelian</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant had taken a Lodging, and was retuned to give his Maſter an Account of it. The Cavaliers grown weary of that ridiculous Entertainment, which was diverting at firſt ſight, retired whither the Lacquey conducted them; who, according to their Directions, had ſought out one of the moſt obſcure Streets in the City. All that day, to the evening, was ſpent in ſending from one Brokers Shop to another, to furniſh them with Habits, ſince they had not time to make any new.</p>
                  <p>There was, it happened, but one to be got Rich enough to pleaſe our young Gentlemen, ſo
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:135663:145"/> many were taken up upon this occaſion. While they were in Diſpute and Complementing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (<hi>Aurelian</hi> proteſting that <hi>Hippolito</hi> ſhould wear it, and he, on 'tother hand, forſwearing it as bitterly) a Servant of <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s came up and ended the Controverſie; telling them, That he had met below with the <hi>Vallet de Chambre</hi> of a Gentleman, who was one of the greateſt Gallants about the Town, but was at this time in ſuch a condition he could not poſſibly be at the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment; whereupon the Vallet had deſigned to dreſs himſelf up in his Maſter's Apparel, and try his talent at Court; which he hearing, told him he would inform him how he might beſtow the Habit for ſome time much more to his profit, if not to his pleaſure, ſo acquainted him with the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion his Maſter had for it. <hi>Hippolito</hi> ſent for the Fellow up, who was not ſo fond of his deſign as not to be bought off it, but upon having his own demand granted for the uſe of it, brought it; it was very Rich, and upon tryal, as fit for <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi> as if it had been made for him. The Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was performed in the Morning, in the great Dome, with all magnificence correſpondent to the wealth of the great Duke, and the eſteem he had for the Noble Pair. The next Morning was to be a Tilting, and the ſame Night a Maſquing Ball at Court, To omit the Deſcription of the univerſal Joy, (that had diffus'd it ſelf through all the Conduits of Wine, which convey'd it in large meaſures to the People) and only relate thoſe effects of it which concern our preſent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers. You muſt know, that about the fall of the Evening, and at that time when the <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librium</hi> of Day and Night, for ſome time, holds
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:135663:145"/> the Air in a gloomy ſuſpence between an unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to leave the light, and a natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe into the Dominion of darkneſs. About this time our Hero's, ſhall I ſay, ſally'd or ſlunk out of their Lodgings, and ſteer'd toward the great Palace, whither, before they were arrived, ſuch a prodigious number of Torches were on fire, that the day, by help of theſe Auxiliary Forces, ſeem'd to continue its Dominion; the Owls and Bats apprehending their miſtake, in counting the hours, retir'd again to a convenient darkneſs; for Madam Night was no more to be ſeen than ſhe was to be heard; and the Chymiſts were of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That her fuliginous Damps rarefy'd by the abundance of Flame, were evaporated.</p>
                  <p>Now the Reader I ſuppoſe to be upon Thorns at this and the like impertinent Digreſſions, but let him alone and he'll come to himſelf; at which time I think fit to acquaint him, that when I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, I am at that time writing to pleaſe my ſelf; when I continue the Thread of the Story, I write to pleaſe him; ſuppoſing him a reaſonable Man, I conclude him ſatisfied to allow me this liberty, and ſo I proceed.</p>
                  <p>If our Cavaliers were dazled at the ſplendour they beheld without doors, what ſurprize, think you, muſt they be in, when entring the Palace they found even the lights there to be but ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny foils to the bright eyes that flaſh'd upon 'em at every turn!</p>
                  <p>A more glorious Troop no occaſion ever aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; all the fair of <hi>Florence,</hi> with the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed Caviliers, were preſent; and however Nature had been partial in beſtowing on ſome better Faces than others, Art was alike indulgent
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:135663:146"/> to all, and induſtriouſly ſupplyed thoſe Defects ſhe had left, giving ſome Addition alſo to her greateſt Excellencies. Every body appear'd well ſhap'd, as it is to be ſuppoſed, none who were conſcious to themſelves of any viſible Deformity would preſume to come thither. Their Apparel was equally glorious, though each differing in fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. In ſhort, our Strangers were ſo well bred, as to conclude from theſe apparent Perfections, that there was not a Maſque which did not at leaſt hide the Face of a Cherubim. Perhaps the Ladies were not behind hand in return of a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Opinion of them: for they were both well dreſs'd, and had ſomething inexpreſſibly pleaſing in their Air and Mien, different from other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and indeed differing from one another. They fanſy'd that while they ſtood together they were more particularly taken notice of than any in the Room, and being unwilling to be taken for Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which they thought they were, by reaſon of ſome whiſpering they obſerved near them. They agreed upon an hour of meeting after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſhould be broke up, and ſo ſeperately min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with the thickeſt of the Aſſembly.
<hi>Aurelian</hi> had fixed his eye upon a Lady whom he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to have been a conſiderable time in cloſe whiſper with another Woman; he expected with great impatience the reſult of that private Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that he might have an opportunity of enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Lady whoſe Perſon was ſo agreeable to him. At laſt he perceived they were broke off, and the
'tother Lady ſeem'd to have taken her leave. He had taken no ſmall pains in the mean time to put himſelf in a poſture to accoſt the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which, no droubt, he had happily performed,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:135663:146"/> had he not been interrupted; but ſcarce had he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted himſelf of a preliminary Bow (and which, I have heard him ſay, was the loweſt that ever he made) and had juſt opened his Lips to deliver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of a ſmall Complement, which, nevertheleſs he was very big with, when he unluckily miſcarried, by the interpoſal of the ſame Lady, whoſe departure not long before, he had ſo zealouſly pray'd for: but, as Providence would have it, there was only ſome very ſmall matter forgot, which was reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in a ſhort whiſper. The Coaſt being again cleared, he took heart and bore up and, ſtriking ſail, repeated his Cemony to the Lady; who, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obligingly returned it, he accoſted her in theſe or the like words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>If I do not uſurp a priviledge reſerved for ſome one more happy in your acquaintance, may I preſume, Madam, to entreat (for a while) the favour of your Converſation, at leaſt till the arrival of whom you expect, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided you are not tired of me before; for then upon the leaſt intimation of uneaſineſs, I will not fail of doing my ſelf the violence to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw for your releaſe.</q> The Lady made him anſwer, ſhe did not expect any body; by which he might imagine her Converſation not of value to be beſpoke, and to afford it him, were but far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to convince him to her own coſt. He reply'd,
<q rend="inline">She had already ſaid enough to convince him of ſomething he heartily wiſhed might not be to his coſt in the end.</q> She pretended not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him, but told him,
<q rend="inline">If he already found himſelf grieved with her Converſation, he would have ſufficient reaſon to repent the raſhneſs of his firſt Demand before they had ended: for that now ſhe intended to hold diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:135663:147"/> with hrm, on purpoſe to puniſh his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedneſs, in preſuming upon a Perſon whoſe Dreſs and Mien might not (may be) be diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to have wit. I muſt confeſs (reply'd <hi>Aurelian</hi>) my ſelf guilty of a Preſumption, and willingly ſubmit to the puniſhment you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend: and though it be an aggravation of a Crime to perſevere in its juſtification, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help defending an Opinion in which now I am more confirm'd, that probable conjectures may be made of the ingenious Diſpoſition of the Mind, from the fancy and choice of Apparel. The humour I grant ye, (ſaid the Lady) or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Perſon, whether melancholick or brisk; but I ſhould hardly paſs my cenſure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo ſlight an indication of Wit: for there is your brisk fool as well as your brisk man of ſenſe, and ſo of the melancholick. I confeſs 'tis poſſible a fool may reveal himſelf by his Dreſs, in wearing ſomething extravagantly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and ridiculous, or in prepoſterous ſuiting of Colours; but a Decency of Habit (which is all that Men of beſt ſenſe pretend to) may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by cuſtom and example, without putting the Perſon to a ſuperfluous expence of Wit for the contrivance; and though there ſhould be occaſion for it, few are ſo unfortunate in their Relations and Acquaintance not to have ſome Friend capable of giving them advice, if they are not too ignorantly conceited to ask it.</q> 
                     <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> was ſo pleaſed with the eaſineſs and ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her Expoſtulation, that he forgot to make a reply, when ſhe ſeem'd to expect it; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Woman of a quick Apprehenſion, and juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible of her own Perfections, ſhe ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:135663:147"/> he did not grudge his attention. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhe had a mind to put it upon him to turn the diſcourſe, ſo went on upon the ſame Subject.
<q rend="inline">Siginor (ſaid ſhe) I have been looking round me, and by your Maxim I cannot diſcover one fool in the Company; for they are all well dreſt. This was ſpoken with an Air of Rallery that awakened the Cavalier, who immediately made anſwer: 'Tis true, Madam, we ſee there may be as much variety of good fancies as of faces, yet there may be many of both kinds borrowed and adulterate if inquired into; and as you are pleaſed to obſerve the invention may be Foreign to the Perſon who puts it in practice; and as good an Opinion as I have of an agreeable Dreſs, I ſhould be loth to anſwer for the Wit of all about us. I believe you, (ſays the Lady) and hope you are convinced of your error, ſince you muſt allow it impoſſible to tell who of all this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly did or did not make choice of their Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel. Not all, (ſaid
<hi>Aurelian</hi>) there is an ungainneſs in ſome which betrays them. Look ye there (ſays he) pointing to a Lady who ſtood playing with the Taſſels of her Girdle, I dare anſwer for that Lady though ſhe be very well dreſs'd, 'tis more than ſhe knows. His fair unknown could not forbear laughing at his particular diſtinction, and freely told him, he had indeed light upon one who knew as little as any body in the Room, her ſelf excepted. Ah! Madam, (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
<hi>Aurelian</hi>) you know every thing in the World but your own Perfections, and you on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know not thoſe, becauſe 'tis the top of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection not to know them. How! (reply'd the Lady) I thought it had been the extremity of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:135663:148"/> knowledge to know ones ſelf. <hi>Aurelian</hi> had a little over-ſtrain'd himſelf in that Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and I am of Opinion would have been puzzl'd to have brought himſelf off readily; but by good fortune the Muſick came into the Room, and gave him an opportunity to ſeem to decline an anſwer, becauſe the company pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to dance: he only told her he was too mean a Conqueſt for her Wit, who was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy a Slave to the Charms of her Perſon. She thanked him for his Complement, and briskly told him ſhe ought to have made him a return in praiſe of his Wit, but ſhe hoped he was a Man more happy than to be diſſatisfy'd with any of his own Endowments; and if it were ſo, that he had not a juſt Opinion of himſelf, ſhe knew her ſelf incapable of ſaying any thing to beget one.</q> 
                     <hi>Aurelian</hi> did not know well what to make of this laſt reply; for he always abhor'd any thing that was conceited, with which this ſeem'd to reproach him. But however mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt he had been heretofore in his own thoughts, yet never was he ſo diſtruſtful of his good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour as now, being rally'd ſo by a Perſon whom he took to be of judgment: Yet he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to take no notice, but with an Air uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and full of good humour entreated her to Dance with him; She promiſed him to Dance with no body elſe, nor I believe had ſhe inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for notwithſtanding her tartneſs, ſhe was upon equal terms with him as to the liking of each others Perſon and Humour, and only gave thoſe little hints to try his Temper; there being certainly no greater ſign of folly and ill breeding, than to grow ſerious and concerned at any thing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:135663:148"/> ſpoken in the rallery; for his part, he was ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inſenſibly fallen in love with her Shape, Wit and Air; which, together with a white Hand, he had ſeen (perhaps not accidentally) were enough to have ſubdued a more ſtubborn Heart than ever he was maſter of; and for her Face, which he had not ſeen, he beſtowed upon her the beſt his Imagination could furniſh him with. I ſhould by right now deſcribe her Dreſs, which was extreamly agreeable and rich, but 'tis poſſible I might err in ſome material Pin or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the ſticking of which may be the whole grace of the Drapery depended. Well, they danced ſeveral times together, and no leſs to the ſatisfaction of the whole Company, than of themſelves; for at the end of each Dance, ſome publick Note of Applauſe or other was given to the graceful Couple.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aurelian</hi> was amaz'd, that among all that danced or ſtood in view he could not ſee
<hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lito;</hi> but concluding that he had met with ſome pleaſing Converſation, and was withdrawn to ſome retired part of the Room, he forbore his ſearch till the mirth of that Night ſhould be over, and the Company ready to break up, where we will leave him for a while, to ſee what became of his adventurous Friend.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hippolito,</hi> a little after he had parted with <hi>Aurelian,</hi> was got among a knot of Ladies and Cavaliers, who were looking upon a large Gold Cup ſet with Jewels, in which his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had drank to the Proſperity of the new mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Couple at Dinner, and which aftewards he preſented to his Couſin <hi>Donna Catharina.</hi> He, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, was very intent, admiring the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, workmanſhip and beauty of the Cup, when
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:135663:149"/> a Lady came behind him, and pulling him by the Elbow, made a ſign ſhe would ſpeak with him; <hi>Hippolito,</hi> who knew himſelf an utter Stranger to
<hi>Florence,</hi> and every body in it, immediately gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſhe had miſtaken him for her acquaintance, as indeed it happened; however he reſolved not to diſcover himſelf till he ſhould be aſſured of it; having followed her into a ſet Window re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from Company, ſhe addreſs'd her ſelf to him in this manner:
<q rend="inline">Signior <hi>Don Lorenzo</hi> (ſaid ſhe) I am overjoy'd to ſee you are ſo ſpeedily recovered of your Wounds, which by report were much more dangerous than to have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered your coming abroad ſo ſoon; but I muſt accuſe you of great indiſcretion, in appearing in a Habit which ſo many muſt needs remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you to have worn upon the like occaſion not long ago, I mean at the Marriage of <hi>Don Cynthio</hi> with your Siſter
<hi>Atalante;</hi> I do aſſure you, you were known by it, both to <hi>Juliana</hi> and my ſelf who was ſo far concerned for you, as to deſire me to tell you, that her Brother <hi>Don Fabritio</hi> (who ſaw you when you came in with another Gentleman) had eyed you very narrowly, and is ſince gone out of the Room, ſhe knows not upon what deſign; however ſhe would have you, for your own ſake, be advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and circumſpect when you depart this place, leſt you ſhould be ſet upon unawares; you know the hatred <hi>Don Frabitio</hi> has born you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince you had the fortune to kill his Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in a Duel: Here ſhe pauſed as if expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his reply; but <hi>Hippolito</hi> was ſo confounded, that he ſtood mute, and contemplating the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard he had ignorantly brought himſelf into,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:135663:149"/> forgot his deſign of informing the Lady of her miſtake. She finding he made her no Anſwer, went on. I perceive (continued ſhe) you are in ſome ſurprize at what I have related, and may be, are doubtful of the Truth; but I thought you had been better acquainted with your Couſin <hi>Leonora</hi>'s Voice, than to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got it ſo ſoon: Yet in Complaiſance to your ill Memory, I will put you paſt doubt, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you my Face; with that ſhe pulled off her Mask, and diſcovered to <hi>Hippolito</hi> (now more amaz'd than ever) the moſt Angelick Face that he had ever beheld. He was juſt about to have made her ſome Anſwer, when, clapping on her Mask again without giving him time, ſhe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily for him purſu'd her Diſcourſe.</q> (For 'tis odds but he had made ſome diſcovery of himſelf in the ſurprize he was in.) Having taken him fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly by the Hand, now ſhe had made her ſelf known to him,
<q rend="inline">Couſin <hi>Lorenzo</hi> (added ſhe) you may perhaps have taken it unkindly, that, during the time of your indiſpoſition, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of your Wounds, I have not been to viſit you; I do aſſure you it was not for want of any Inclination I had both to ſee and ſerve you to my power; but you are well acquainted with the Severity of my Father, whom you know how lately you have diſobliged. I am mighty glad that I have met with you here, where I have had an Opportunity to tell you what ſo much concerns your Safety, which I am afraid you will not find in <hi>Florence;</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the great Power <hi>Don Fabritio</hi> and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Marqueſs of <hi>Viterbo,</hi> have in this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I have another thing to inform you of,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:135663:150"/> That whereas <hi>Don Fabio</hi> had intereſted himſelf in your Cauſe, in Oppoſition to the Marqueſs of <hi>Viterbo,</hi> by reaſon of the long Animoſity between them, all hopes of his Countenance and Aſſiſtance are defeated: For there has been a Propoſal of Reconciliation made to both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and it is ſaid it will be confirm'd (as moſt ſuch ancient Quarrels are at laſt) by the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of <hi>Juliana</hi> the Marqueſs's Daughter, with <hi>Aurelian,</hi> Son to <hi>Don Fabian:</hi> to which effect the old Gentleman ſent 'tother Day to <hi>Siena,</hi> where <hi>Aurelian</hi> has been Educated, to haſten his coming to Town; but the Meſſenger return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Morning, brought word, That the ſame day he arriv'd at <hi>Siena, Aurelian</hi> had ſet out for <hi>Florence,</hi> in Company with a young
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nobleman, his intimate Friend, ſo it is believ'd they are both in Town, and not unlikely in this Room in Maſquerade.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hippolito</hi> could not forbear ſmiling to himſelf, at theſe laſt words. For ever ſince the naming of <hi>Don Fabio</hi> he had been very attentive; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, his Thoughts were wholly taken up with the Beauty of the Face he had ſeen, and from the time ſhe had taken him by the Hand, a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive warmth and chillneſs had play'd about his Heart, and ſurpriz'd him with an unuſual Tranſport. He was in a hundred Minds, whether he ſhould make her ſenſible of her Error or no; but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering he could expect no farther Conference with her after he ſhould diſcover himſelf, and that as yet he knew not of her place of abode, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to humour the miſtake a little further. Having her ſtill by the Hand, which he ſqueez'd ſomewhat more eargerly than is uſual for Couſins
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:135663:150"/> to do, in a low and undiſtinguiſhable Voice, he let her know how much he held himſelf obliged to her, and avoiding as many words as handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he could, at the ſame time, entreated her to give him her Advice, toward the management of himſelf in this Affair.
<hi>Leonora,</hi> who never from the beginning had entertain'd the leaſt Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of diſtruſt, imagined he ſpoke faintly, as not being yet perfectly recovered in his ſtrength; and withal conſidering that the heat of the Room, by reaſon of the Crowd, might be uneaſie to a Perſon in his Condition; ſhe kindly told him, That if he were as inclinable to diſpenſe with the remainder of that Nights Diverſion as ſhe was, and had no other engagement upon him, by her conſent, they ſhould both ſteal out of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and go to her Houſe, where they might with more freedom diſcourſe about a buſineſs of that importance, and where he might take ſomething to refreſh himſelf if he were (as ſhe conceiv'd him to be) indiſpoſed with his long ſtanding. Judge you whether the Propoſal were accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to
<hi>Hippolito</hi> or no; he had been ruminating with himſelf how to bring ſomething like this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and had almoſt deſpair'd of it; when of a ſuddain he found the ſucceſs of his deſign had prevented his own endeavours. He told his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin in the ſame key as before, That he was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be the occaſion of her Divorce from ſo much good Company; but for his own part, he was afraid he had preſumed too much upon his recovery in coming abroad ſo ſoon, and that he found himſelf ſo unwell, he feared he ſhould be quickly forc'd to retire.
<hi>Leonora</hi> ſtay'd not to make him any other reply, only tipp'd him upon
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:135663:151"/> the Arm, and bid him follow her at a convenient diſtance to avoid Obſervation.</p>
                  <p>Whoever had ſeen the Joy that was in <hi>Hippoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s Countenance, and the Sprightlineſs with which he follow'd his Beautiful Conductreſs, would ſcarce have taken him for a Perſon griev'd with uncured Wounds. She led him down a back pair of Stairs, into one of the Palace Gardens which had a Door opening into the Piazza, not far from where <hi>Don Mario</hi> her Father lived. They had little diſcourſe by the way, which gave <hi>Hippolito</hi> time to conſider of the beſt way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering himſelf. A thouſand things came into his Head in a minute, yet nothing that pleaſed him: and after ſo many Contrivances as he had formed for the diſcovery of himſelf, he found it more rational for him not to reveal himſelf at all that Night, ſince he could not foreſee what effect the ſurprize would have, ſhe muſt needs be in, at the appearance of a Stranger, whom ſhe had never ſeen before, yet whom ſhe had treated ſo familiarly. He knew Women were apt to ſhriek or ſwoon upon ſuch Occaſions, and ſhould ſhe happen to do either, he might be at a loſs how to bring himſelf off. He thought he might eaſily pretend to be indiſpoſed ſomewhat more than ordinary, and ſo make an excuſe to go to his own Lodging. It came into his Head too, that under pretence of giving her an account of his Health, he might enquire of her the means how a Letter might be convey'd to her the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherein he might inform her gently of her miſtake, and inſinuate ſomething of that Paſſion he had conceiv'd, which he was ſure he could not have opportunity to ſpeak of if he bluntly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:135663:151"/> revealed himſelf. He had juſt reſolv'd upon this Method, as they were come to the great Gates of the Court, when <hi>Leonora</hi> ſtopping to let him go in before her, he of a ſuddain fetch'd his Breath violently, as if ſome ſtitch or twinging ſmart had juſt then aſſaulted him. She enquired the matter of him, and adviſed him to make haſte into the Houſe that he might ſit down and reſt him. He told her he found himſelf ſo ill, that he judged it more convenient for him to go home while he was in a condition to move, for he fear'd if he ſhould once ſettle himſelf to reſt, he might not be able to ſtir. She was much troubled, and would have had a Chair made ready and Servants to carry him home; but he made anſwer, he would not have any of her Fathers Servants know of his being abroad, and that juſt now he had an interval of eaſe, which he hop'd would continue till he made a ſhift to reach his own Lodgings. Yet if ſhe pleaſed to inform him how he might give an account of himſelf the next morning, in a line or two, he would not fail to give her the thanks due to her great kindneſs; and withal, would let her know ſomething which would not a little ſurprize her, though now he had not time to acquaint her with it. She ſhow'd him a little Window at the corner of the Houſe, where one ſhould wait to receive his Letter, and was juſt taking her leave of him, when ſeeing him ſearch haſtily in his Pocket, ſhe ask'd him if he miſs'd any thing; he told her he thought a Wound wich was not throughly heal'd bled a little, and that he had loſt his Handkerchief. His deſign took; for ſhe immediately gave him hers: which indeed accordingly he apply'd to the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:135663:152"/> only Wound he was then griev'd with; which though it went quite through his Heart, yet thank God was not Mortal. He was not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle rejoyc'd at his good Fortune in getting ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Favour from his Miſtreſs, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the violence he did himſelf to perſonate a ſick Man, he could not forbear giving ſome Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms of an extraordinary content; and telling her that he did not doubt to receive a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Proportion of eaſe from the Application of what had ſo often kiſs'd her fair Hand. <hi>Leonora,</hi> who did not ſuſpect the Compliment, told him ſhe ſhould be heartily glad if that, or any thing in her power, might contribute to his recovery; and wiſhing him well home, went into her Houſe, as much troubled for her Couſin as he was joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for his Miſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hippolito</hi> as ſoon as ſhe was gone in, began to make his Remarks about the Houſe, walking round the great Court, viewing the Gardens and all the Paſſages leading to that ſide of the Piazza. Having ſufficiently informed himſelf, with a Heart full of Love, and a Head full of Stratagem, he walked toward his Lodging, impatient till the arrival of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> that he might give himſelf vent. In which interim, let me take the liberty to digreſs a little, and tell the Reader ſomething which I do not doubt he has apprehended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf long ago, if he be not the dulleſt Reader in the World; yet only for order ſake, let me tell him I ſay, That a young Gentleman (Couſin to the aforeſaid <hi>Don Fabritio</hi>) happened one night to have ſome words at a Gameing Houſe with one <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> which created a Quarrel of fatal Conſequence to the former, who was killed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:135663:152"/>the Spot, and likely to be ſo to the latter, who was very deſperately wounded.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fabritio</hi> being much concerned for his Kinſman, vow'd Revenge (according to the ancient and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Cuſtom of <hi>Italy</hi>) upon <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> if he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd; or, in caſe of his Death, (if it ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to anticipate that, much more ſwinging Death which he had in ſtore for him) upon his next of Kin, and ſo to deſcend Lineally like an Engliſh Eſtate, to all the Heirs Males of his Family. This ſame <hi>Fabritio</hi> had indeed (as
<hi>Leonora</hi> told <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi>) taken particular notice of him from his firſt Entrance into the Room, and was ſo far doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as to go out immediately himſelf, and make enquiry concerning <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> but was quickly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of the greatneſs of his Error, in believing a Man to be abroad, who was ſo ill of his Wounds, that they now deſpair'd of his Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; and thereupon return'd to the Ball very well ſatisfied, but not before
<hi>Leonora</hi> and <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lito</hi> were departed.</p>
                  <p>So, Reader, having now diſcharg'd my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of a ſmall Diſcovery which I thought my ſelf obliged to make to thee, I proceed to tell thee, that our Friend <hi>Aurelian</hi> had by this time danced himſelf into a Net, which he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could, nor which is worſe, deſired to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle.</p>
                  <p>His Soul was charm'd to the Movement of her Body; an Air ſo graceful, ſo ſweet, ſo eaſie and ſo great, he had never ſeen. She had ſomething of Majeſty in her, which appear'd to be born with her; and though it ſtruck an Awe into the Beholders, yet was it ſweetned with a Familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Behaviour, which render'd it agreeable to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:135663:153"/> every Body. The Grandeur of her Mien was not ſtiff, but unſtudied and unforc'd, mixed with a ſimplicity; free, yet not looſe nor affected. If the former ſeem'd to condeſcend, the latter ſeem'd to aſpire; and both to unite in the Centre of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Every turn ſhe gave in Dancing ſnatcht <hi>Aurelian</hi> into a Rapture, and he had like to have been out two or three times with following his Eyes, which ſhe led about as Slaves to her Heels.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as they had done dancing, he began to complain of his want of Breath and Lungs, to ſpeak ſufficiently in her Commendation: She ſmilingly told him, he did ill to dance ſo much then: Yet in Conſideration of the pains he had taken more than ordinary upon her account, ſhe would bate him a great deal of Complement, but with this Proviſo, That he was to diſcover to her who he was. <hi>Aurelian</hi> was unwilling for the preſent to own himſelf to be really the Man he was; when a ſuddain thought came into his Head to take upon him the Name and Character of
<hi>Hippolito,</hi> who he was ſure was not known in <hi>Florence.</hi> He thereupon, after a little pauſe, pretended to recal himſelf in this manner:
<q rend="inline">Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, it is no ſmall demonſtration of the entire Reſignation which I have made of my Heart to your Chains, ſince the ſecrets of it are no longer in my power. I confeſs I only took <hi>Florence</hi> in my way, not deſigning any longer Reſidence, than ſhould be requiſite to inform the Curioſity of a Traveller, of the rareties of the Place. Whether Happineſs or Miſery will be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of that Curioſity, I am yet in fear, and ſubmit to your Determination; but ſure I am, not to depart <hi>Florence</hi> till you have made
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:135663:153"/> me the moſt miſerable Man in it, and refuſe me the fatal Kindneſs of Dying at your Feet. I am by Birth a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> of the City of <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do;</hi> my name
<hi>Hippolito di Saviolina:</hi> I was ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday a Man free, as Nature made the firſt; to day I am fallen into a Captivity, which muſt continue with my Life, and which, it is in your power, to make much dearer to me. Thus in obedience to your Commands, and contrary to my Reſolution of remaining unknown in this place, I have inform'd you, Madam, what I am; what I ſhall be, I deſire to know from you; at leaſt, I hope, the free diſcovery I have made of my ſelf, will encourage you to truſt me with the knowledge of your Perſon.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here a low bow, and a deep ſigh, put an end to his Diſcourſe, and ſignified his Expectation of her Reply, which was to this purpoſe—(But I had forgot to tell you, That
<hi>Aurelian</hi> kept off his Mask from the time that he told her he was of <hi>Spain,</hi> till the period of his Relation.)
<q rend="inline">Had I thought (ſaid ſhe) that my Curioſity would have brought me in debt, I ſhould certainly have forborn it; or at leaſt have agreed with you before hand about the rate of your diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then I had not brought my ſelf to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency of being cenſur'd, either of too much eaſineſs or reſervedneſs; but to avoid, as much as I can, the extremity of either, I am reſolv'd but to diſcover my ſelf in part, and will endeavour to give you as little occaſion as I can, either to boaſt of, or ridicule the Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the Women of
<hi>Florence</hi> in your Travels.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aurelian</hi> interrupted her, and ſwore very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly (and the more heartily I believe, becauſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:135663:154"/> he then indeed ſpoke truth) that he would make <hi>Florence</hi> the place of his abode, whatever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns he had elſewhere. She adviſed him to be cautious how he ſwore to his Expreſſions of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry; and farther told him ſhe now hoped ſhe ſhould make him a return to all the Fine Things he had ſaid, ſince ſhe gave him his choice whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would know whom ſhe was, or ſee her Face.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aurelian</hi> who was really in Love, and in whom Conſideration would have been a Crime, greedily embrac'd the latter, ſince ſhe aſſured him at that time he ſhould not know both. Well, what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd? Why, ſhe pull'd off her Mask, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to him at once in the Glory of Beauty. But who can tell the aſtoniſhment <hi>Aurelian</hi> felt? He was for a time ſenſeleſs; Admiration had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd his Speech, and his Eyes were entangled in Light. In ſhort, to be made ſenſible of his condition, we muſt conceive ſome Idea of what he beheld, which is not to be imagined till ſeen, nor then to be expreſs'd. Now ſee the imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and conceitedneſs of an Author, who will have a fling at a Deſcription, which he has Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced with an impoſſibility. One might have ſeen ſomething in her Compoſition reſembling the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of <hi>Epicurus</hi> his World, as if every Attome of Beauty had concurr'd to unite an excellency. Had that curious Painter lived in her days, he might have avoided his painful ſearch, when he collected from the choiceſt pieces the moſt choice Features, and by a due Diſpoſition and Judicious Symmetry of thoſe exquiſite parts, made one whole and perfect <hi>Venus.</hi> Nature ſeem'd here to have play'd the Plagiary, and to have molded
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:135663:154"/> into Subſtance the moſt refined Thoughts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Poets. Her Eyes diffus'd Rays comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as warmth, and piercing as the Light; they would have worked a paſſage through the ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Pores, and with a delicious heat, have play'd about the moſt obdurate Frozen Heart, until 'twere melted down to Love. Such Majeſty and Affability were in her Looks; ſo alluring, yet commanding was her Preſence, that it mingled Awe with Love; kindling a Flame which trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to aſpire. She had danced much, which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with her being cloſe masked, gave her a tincture of Carnation more than ordinary. But <hi>Aurelian</hi> (from whom I had every tittle of her Deſcription) fancy'd he ſaw a little Neſt of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pids break from the Treſſes of her Hair, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one officiouſly betake himſelf to his task. Some fann'd with their downy Wings, her glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cheeks; while others bruſh'd the balmy Dew from off her Face, leaving alone a heavenly Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture blubbing on her Lips, on which they drank and revell'd for their pains: Nay, ſo particular were their allotments in her Service, that
<hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> was very poſitive a young Cupid who was but juſt Pen-feather'd, employ'd his naked Quills to pick her Teeth. And a thouſand other things his tranſport repreſented to him, which none but Lovers who have experience of ſuch Viſions will believe.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as he awaked and found his Speech come to him, he employ'd it to this effect:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="inline">'Tis enough that I have ſeen a Divinity— Nothing but Mercy can inhabit theſe Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons— Their utmoſt rigour brings a Death pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to any Life, but what they give—Uſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:135663:155"/> me, Madam, as you pleaſe; for by your fair ſelf, I cannot think a Bliſs beyond what now I feel— You Wound with Pleaſure, and if you Kill it muſt be with Tranſport— Ah! Yet methinks to live— O Heaven! to have Life pronounced by thoſe Bleſs'd Lips— Did they not inſpire where they command, it were an immediate Death of Joy.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aurelian</hi> was growing a little too loud with his Admiration, had ſhe not juſt then interrupted him, by clapping on her Maſque, and telling him they ſhould be obſerved, if he proceeded in his Extravagance; and withal, that his Paſſion was too ſuddain to be real, and too violent to be laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He replied, Indeed it might not be very laſting, (with a ſubmiſſive mournful Voice) but it would continue during his Life. That it was ſudden, he denied, for ſhe had raiſed it by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from his firſt ſight of her, by a continued diſcovery of Charms, in her Mien and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till ſhe thought fit to ſet Fire to the Train ſhe had laid, by the Lightning of her Face; and then he could not help it, if he were blown up.</p>
                  <p>He begg'd her to believe the Sincerity of his Paſſion, at leaſt to enjoyn him ſomething, which might tend to the Convincing of her Incredulity. She ſaid, ſhe ſhould find a time to make ſome Trials of him; but for the firſt, ſhe charged him not to follow or obſerve her, after the Diſſolution of the Aſſembly. He promiſed to obey, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated her to tell him but her Name, that he might have Recourſe to that in his Affliction for her Abſence, if he were able to ſurvive it. She deſired him to live by all means; and if he muſt have a Name to play with, to call her <hi>Incognita,</hi> till he were better informed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:135663:155"/>The Company breaking up, ſhe took her leave, and at his earneſt Entreaty, gave him a ſhort Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her Face; which, then dreſs'd in an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſmile cauſed another fit of Tranſport, which laſted till ſhe was gone out of Sight. <hi>Aurelian</hi> gathered up his Spirits, and walked ſlowly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Lodging, never remembring that he had loſt <hi>Hippolito,</hi> till upon turning the Corner of a Street, he heard a noiſe of Fighting; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near, ſaw a Man make a vigorous Defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt two, who preſſed violently upon him. He then thought of <hi>Hippolito,</hi> and fancying he ſaw the glimmering of Diamond Buttons, ſuch as <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi> had upon the Sleeves of his Habit, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately drew to his Aſſiſtance; and with that Eagerneſs and Reſolution, that the Aſſailants, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their unmanly odds defeated, took to their Heels. The Perſon reſcued by the Generous Help of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> came toward him; but as he would have ſtop'd to have ſaluted him, dropp'd, faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his feet. <hi>Aurelian,</hi> now he was ſo near him, perceiv'd plainly
<hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Habit, and ſtep'd haſtily to take him up. Juſt as ſome of the Guards (who were going the Rounds, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of ſuch Diſorders in an Univerſal Merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) came up to him with Lights, and had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Priſoners the Two Men, whom they met with their Swords drawn; when looking in the Face of the Wounded Man, he found it was not <hi>Hippolito,</hi> but his Governour <hi>Claudio,</hi> in the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit he had worn at the Ball. He was extreamly ſurpriz'd, as were the Priſoners, who confeſs'd their Deſign to have been upon <hi>Lorenzo;</hi> ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Miſtake upon the Habit which was known to have been his. They were Two Men who formerly had been Servants to him, whom <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had unfortunately ſlain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:135663:156"/>They made a ſhift to bring <hi>Claudio</hi> to himſelf; and part of the Guard carrying off the Priſoners, whom <hi>Aurelian</hi> deſired they would ſecure, the reſt accompanied him bearing <hi>Claudio</hi> in their Arms to his Lodging. He had not patience to forbear asking for <hi>Hippolito</hi> by the Way; whom <hi>Claudio</hi> aſſured him, he had left ſafe in his Chamber, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Two Hours ſince. That his coming Home ſo long before the Divertiſements were ended, and Undreſſing himſelf, had given him the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Curioſity, to put on his Habit, and go to the Palace; in his Return from whence, he was ſet upon in the Manner he found him, which if he recovered, he muſt own his Life indebted to his timely Aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>Being come to the Houſe, they carried him to his Bed, and having ſent for Surgeons,
<hi>Aurelian</hi> rewarded and diſmiſſed the Guard. He ſtay'd the dreſſing of
<hi>Claudio</hi>'s Wounds, which were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, though they hop'd none Mortal: and leaving him to his Reſt, went to give <hi>Hippolito</hi> an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what had happened, whom he found with a Table before him, leaning upon both his Elbows, his Face covered with his Hands, and ſo motionleſs, that <hi>Aurelian</hi> concluded he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep; ſeeing ſeveral Papers lie before him, half written and blotted out again, he thought to ſteal ſoftly to the Table, and diſcover what he had been employed about. Juſt as he reach'd forth his Hand to take up one of the Papers, <hi>Hippolito</hi> ſtarted up ſo on the ſuddain, as ſurpriz'd
<hi>Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and made him leap back; <hi>Hippolito,</hi> on the other hand, not ſuppoſing that any Body had been near him, was ſo diſordered with the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a Man at his Elbow, (whom his Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:135663:156"/> did not permit him to diſtinguiſh) that he leap'd haſtily to his Sword, and in turning him about, overthrew the Stand and Candles. Here were they both left in the Dark,
<hi>Hippolito</hi> gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping about with his Sword, and thruſting at every Chair that he felt oppoſe him. <hi>Aurelian</hi> was ſcarce come to himſelf, when thinking to ſtep back toward the Door that he might inform his Friend of his Miſtake, without expoſing himſelf to his blind Fury; <hi>Hippolito</hi> heard him ſtir, and made a full thruſt with ſuch Violence, that the Hilt of the Sword meeting with <hi>Aurelian</hi>'s Breaſt beat him down, and
<hi>Hippolito</hi> a top of him, as a Servant alarm'd with the noiſe, came into the Chamber with a Light. The Fellow trembled, and thought they were both Dead, till <hi>Hippolito</hi> raiſing himſelf, to ſee whom he had got under him, ſwoon'd away upon the diſcovery of his Friend. But ſuch was the extraordinary Care of Providence in directing the Sword, that it only paſt under his Arm, giving no Wound to <hi>Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> but a little Bruiſe between his Shoulder and Breaſt with the Hilt. He got up, ſcarce recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his Fright, and by the help of the Servant, laid <hi>Hippolito</hi> upon the Bed; who when he was come to himſelf could hardly be perſwaded, that his Friend was before him and alive, till he ſhew'd him his Breaſt, where was nothing of a Wound. <hi>Hippolito</hi> begg'd his Pardon a Thouſand Times, and curs'd himſelf as often, who was ſo near to committing the moſt Execrable Act of Amicide.</p>
                  <p>They diſmiſs'd the Fellow, and with many Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, congratulated their fortunate Delivery from the Miſchief which came ſo near them
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:135663:157"/> each blaming himſelf as the Occaſion: <hi>Aurelian</hi> accuſing his own unadviſedneſs in ſtealing upon <hi>Hippolito; Hippolito</hi> blaming his own temerity and weakneſs, in being ſo eaſily frighted to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order; and laſt of all, his blindneſs, in not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his deareſt Friend. But there he gave a Sigh, and paſſionately taking
<hi>Aurelian</hi> by the Hand, cry'd, Ah! my Friend; Love is indeed blind, when it would not ſuffer me to ſee you— There aroſe another Sigh; a Sympathy ſeiz'd <hi>Aurelian</hi> immediately: (For, by the Way, ſighing is as catching among Lovers, as yawning among the Vulger.) Beſide hearing the Name of Love, made him fetch ſuch a Sigh, that <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s were but Fly-blows in Compariſon, that was anſwered with all the Might <hi>Hippolito</hi> had,
<hi>Aurelian</hi> ply'd him cloſe till they were both out of Breath.</p>
                  <p>Thus not a Word paſs'd, though each won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred why the t'other ſigh'd, at laſt concluded it to be only Complaiſance to one another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aurelian</hi> broke the Silence, by telling him the Misfortune of his Governour.
<hi>Hippolito</hi> rejoyc'd as at the luckieſt Accident which could have befall'n him.
<hi>Aurelian</hi> wondered at his unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Mirth, and demanded the Cauſe of it; he anſwer'd, It would neceſſitate his longer Stay in <hi>Florence,</hi> and for ought he knew be the Means of bringing a happy Period to his Amour.</p>
                  <p>His Friend thought him to be little better than a Mad-man, when he perceiv'd him of a ſuddain ſnatch out of his Boſom a Handkerchief, which having kiſs'd with a great deal of Ardour, he took <hi>Aurelian</hi> by the Hand, and ſmiling at the Surprize he ſaw him in:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="inline">Your <hi>Florentine Cupid</hi> is certainly (ſaid he)
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:135663:157"/> the moſt Expert in the World. I have ſince I ſaw you beheld the moſt Beautiful of Women. I am faln deſperately in Love with her, and thoſe Papers which you ſee ſo blotted and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, are but ſo many Eſſays which I have made to the Declaration of my Paſſion. And this Handkerchief which I ſo zealouſly Careſs, is the Ineſtimable Token which I have to make my ſelf known to her. O <hi>Leonora!</hi> (continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he) how haſt thou ſtamp'd thine Image on my Soul! How much dearer am I to my ſelf, ſince I have had thy Heavenly Form in keeping! Now, my <hi>Aurelian,</hi> I am worth thee; my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Love has Dignified me, and rais'd me far above thy poor former Deſpicable <hi>Hippolito.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aurelian</hi> ſeeing the Rapture he was in, thought it in vain to expect a ſettled Relation of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, ſo was reaching to the Table for fome of the Papers, but
<hi>Hippolito</hi> told him, If he would have a little patience he would acquaint him with the whole Matter; and thereupon told him Word for Word how he was miſtaken for <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> and his Management of himſelf. <hi>Aurelian</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his Prudence, in not diſcovering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and told him, If he could ſpare ſo much time from the Contemplation of his Miſtreſs, he would inform him of an Adventure, though not ſo Accidental, yet of as great Concern to his own future Happineſs. So related all that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to him with his Beautiful
<hi>Incognita.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having ended the Story, they began to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the Means they were to uſe toward a Review of their Miſtreſſes. <hi>Aurelian</hi> was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded at the Difficulty he conceived on his Part. He underſtoood from <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Adventure, that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:135663:158"/> his Father knew of his being in Town, whom he muſt unavoidably Diſoblige if he yet concealed himſelf, and Diſobey if he came into his Sight; for he had already entertain'd an Averſion for <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liana,</hi> in apprehenſion of her being Impoſed on him. His <hi>Incognita</hi> was rooted in his Heart, yet could he not Comfort himſelf with any Hopes when he ſhould ſee her: He knew not where ſhe lived, and ſhe had made him no Promiſe of a ſecond Conference. Then did he repent his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate Choice, in preferring the momentary Viſion of her Face, to a certain Intelligence of her Perſon. Every thought that ſucceeded di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted him, and all the Hopes he could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume upon, were within compaſs of the Two Days Merriment yet to come; for which Space he hop'd he might excuſe his remaining conceal'd to his Father.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hippolito</hi> on the other ſide (though <hi>Aurelian</hi> thought him in a much better Way) was no leſs afflicted for himſelf. The Difficulties which he ſaw in his Friend's Circumſtances, put him upon finding out-a great many more in his own, than really there were. But what terrified him moſt of all, was his being an utter Stranger to <hi>Leono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra;</hi> ſhe had not the leaſt knowledge of him but through miſtake; and conſequently could form no Idea of him to his Advantage. He look'd upon it as an unlucky thought in <hi>Aurelian</hi> to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him his Name, ſince poſſibly the Two Ladies were acquainted; and ſhould they communicate to each other their Adventures, they might both reaſonably ſuffer in their Opinions, and be thought guilty of Falſhoood, ſince it would appear to them as One Perſon pretending to Two.
<hi>Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:135663:158"/> told him, there was but one Remedy for that, which was for
<hi>Hippolito,</hi> in the ſame Manner that he had done, to make uſe of his Name, when he writ to <hi>Leonora,</hi> and uſe what Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he could to perſwade her to Secrecy, leaſt his Father ſhould know of the Reaſon which kept him concealed in Town. And it was likely, though perhaps ſhe might not immediately enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Paſſion, yet ſhe would out of Generoſity conceal, what was hidden only for her ſake.</p>
                  <p>Well this was concluded on, after a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Reaſons uſed on either Side, in favour of the Contrivance; they at laſt argued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a Belief, that Fortune had befriended them with a better Plot, than their regular Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing could have contriv'd. So ſoon had they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd themſelves, in what they were willing to believe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aurelian</hi> laid himſelf down to reſt, that is, upon the Bed; for he was a better Lover than to pretend to ſleep that Night, while <hi>Hippolito</hi> ſet himſelf again to frame his Letter deſign'd for <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onora.</hi> He writ ſeveral, at laſt pitched upon one, and very probably the worſt, as you may gueſs when you read it in its proper Place.</p>
                  <p>It was break of Day when the Servant, who had been employed all the foregoing Day in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Accoutrements for the Two Cavaliers, to appear in at the Tilting, came into the Room, and told them all the Young Gentlemen in the Town were trying their Equipage, and preparing to be early in the Liſts. They made themſelves ready with all Expedition at the Alarm: and <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi> having made a Viſit to his Governour, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd a Meſſenger with the Letter and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:135663:159"/> to <hi>Leonora.</hi> At the Signal agreed upon the Caſement was opened and a String let down, to which the Bearer having faſtned the Letter, ſaw it drawn up, and returned. It were avain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to deſcribe <hi>Leonora</hi>'s Surprize, when ſhe read the Superſcription.— <hi>The Unfortunate</hi> Aurelian, <hi>to the Beautiful</hi> Leonora— After ſhe was a little recovered from her Amaze, ſhe recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to her ſelf all the Paſſages between her and her ſuppoſed Couſin, and immediately concluded him to be
<hi>Aurelian.</hi> Then ſeveral little Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which ſhe thought might have been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to have convinced her, repreſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to her; and ſhe was in a ſtrange Uneaſineſs to think of her free Carriage to a Stranger.</p>
                  <p>She was once in a Mind to have burn'd the Letter, or to have ſtay'd for an Opportunity to ſend it again. But ſhe was a Woman, and her Curioſity oppoſed it ſelf to all thoughts of that Nature: at length with a firm Reſolution, ſhe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened it, and found Word for Word, what is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwritten.</p>

I could not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately diſengage my ſelf from that Maze of Charms, to let you know how unworthy a Captive your Eyes had made through miſtake. Sure, Madam, you
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:135663:159"/> cannot but remember my Diſorder, of which your Innocent (Innocent, though perhaps to me Fatal) Error made a Charitable (but wide) Conſtruction. Your Tongue purſued the Victory of your Eyes, and you did not give me time to rally my poor Diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Senſes, ſo as to make a tolerable Retreat. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Madam, the Continuation of the Deceipt, and call it not ſo, that I appear'd to be other than my ſelf; for Heaven knows I was not then my ſelf, nor am I now my own. You told me ſomething that concern'd me nearly, as to a Marriage my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſign'd me, and much more nearly in being told by you. For Heaven's ſake, diſcloſe not to any Body your Knowledge of me, that I may not be forced to an immediate Act of Diſobedience; for if my future Services and inviolate Love, cannot recommend me to your Favour, I ſhall find more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the cold Embraces of a Grave, than in the Arms of the never ſo much admired (but by me dreaded) <hi>Juliana.</hi> Think, Madam, of thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Cicumſtances I lie under; and withal I beg you, think it is in your Power, and only in your Power, to make them happy as my Wiſhes, or much more miſerable than I am able to imagine. That dear, ineſtimable (though undeſign'd) Favour which I receiv'd from you, ſhall this Day diſtinguiſh me from the Crowd of your Admirers; that which I really applied to my inward bleeding Wound, the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com Wound which you have made, and which, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs from you, does wiſh no Cure; then pardon and have pity on, O Adored <hi>Leonora,</hi> him, who is your's by Creation as he is Heaven's, though never ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy.

                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:135663:160"/>She read the Letter over and over, then flung it by, then read it again; the Novelty of the Adventure made her repeat her Curioſity, and take more than ordinary Pains to underſtand it. At laſt her Familiarity with the Expreſſions grew to an Intimacy, and what ſhe at firſt permitted ſhe now began to like. She thought there was ſomething in it a little more ſerious, than to be barely Gallantry. She wondred at her own Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and fancy'd ſhe could remember ſomething of a more becoming Air in the Stranger than was uſual to
<hi>Lorenzo.</hi> This thought was parent to another of the ſame kind, till a long Chain ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively had Birth, and every one ſomewhat more than other, in Favour of the ſuppoſed <hi>Aurelian.</hi> She reflected upon his Diſcretion, in deferring the Diſcovery of himſelf, till a little time had, as it were, weaned her from her perſwaſion, and by removing her farther from her Miſtake, had prepared her for a full and determinate Convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. She thought his Behaviour, in perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Sick Man ſo readily, upon the firſt hint was not amiſs, and ſmil'd to think of his Excuſe to procure her Handkerchief; and laſt of all, his ſifting out the Means to write to her, which he had done with that Modeſty and Reſpect, ſhe could not tell how to find fault with it.</p>
                  <p>She had proceeded thus far in a maze of Thought, when ſhe ſtarted to find her ſelf ſo loſt to her Reaſon, and would have trod back again that path of deluding Fancy; accuſing her ſelf of Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and inconſiderate Eaſineſs, in giving Credit to the Letter of a Perſon whoſe Face ſhe never ſaw, and whoſe firſt Acquaintance with her was a Treachery, and he who could ſo readily deliver
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:135663:160"/> his Tongue of a Lye upon a Surprize, was ſcarce to be truſted when he had ſufficient Time allow'd him to beget a Fiction, and Means to perfect the Birth.</p>
                  <p>How did ſhe know this to be <hi>Aurelian,</hi> if he were? Nay farther, put it to the Extreamity, What if ſhe ſhould upon farther Converſation with him proceed to Love him? What Hopes were there for her? Or how could ſhe conſent to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a Man already Deſtined for another Woman? nay, a Woman that was her Friend, whoſe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying with him was to compleat the happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation of Two Noble Families, and which might prevent the Effuſion of much Blood likely to be ſhed in that Quarrel: Beſides, ſhe ſhould incurr ſhare of the Guilt, which he would draw upon him by Diſobedience to his Father, whom ſhe was ſure would not be conſenting to it.</p>
                  <p>'Tis ſtrange now, but all Accounts agree, that juſt here <hi>Leonora,</hi> who had run like a violent Stream againſt <hi>Aurelian</hi> hitherto, now retorted with as much precipitation in his Favour. I could never get any Body to give me a ſatisfactory Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for her ſudden and dextrous Change of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on juſt at that ſtop; which made me conclude ſhe could not help it; and that Nature boil'd over in her at that time when it had ſo fair an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſhow it ſelf: For <hi>Leonora</hi> it ſeems was a Woman Beautiful, and otherwiſe of an excellent Diſpoſition; but in the Bottom a very Woman. This laſt Objection, this Opportunity of perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Man to Diſobedience, determined the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Favour of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> more than all his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and Qualifications, take him as <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> or
<hi>Hippolito,</hi> or both together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:135663:161"/>Well, the Spirit of Contradiction and of <hi>Eve</hi> was ſtrong in her; and ſhe was in a fair Way to Love <hi>Aurelian,</hi> for ſhe lik'd him already; that it was
<hi>Aurelian</hi> ſhe no longer doubted, for had it been a Villain, who had only taken his Name upon him for any ill Deſigns, he would never have ſlip'd ſo favourable an Opportunity as when they were alone, and in the Night coming through the Garden and broad Space before the Piazza. In ſhort, thus much he reſolv'd, at leaſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the Knowledge ſhe had of him, as he had entreated her in his Letter, and to make particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Remarks of his Behaviour that Day in the Liſts, which ſhould it happen to Charm her with an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute liking of his Perſon, ſhe reſolv'd to dreſs her ſelf to the beſt Advantage, and muſtering up all her Graces, out of pure Revenge to kill him down right.</p>
                  <p>I would not have the Reader now be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and look upon this to be force, or a whim of the Author's, that a Woman ſhould proceed ſo far in her Approbation of a Man whom ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw, that it is impoſſible, therefore ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to ſuppoſe it. Let me tell ſuch a Critick, that he knows nothing of the Sex, if he does not know that a Woman may be taken with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and Deſcription of a Man, when general and extraordinary, that ſhe may be prepoſſeſs'd with an agreeable Idea of his Perſon and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; and though ſhe cannot imagine his real Features, or manner of Wit, yet ſhe has a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Notion of what is call'd a fine Gentleman, and is prepar'd to like ſuch a one who does not diſagree with that Character. <hi>Aurelian,</hi> as he bore a fair Character, ſo was he extreamly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:135663:161"/> to make it good, which otherways might have been to his prejudice; for oftentimes, through an imprudent Indulgence to our Friends merit, we give ſo large a Deſcription of his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that People make more room in their Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, than the Intrinſick worth of the Man will fill, which renders him ſo much the more deſpicable as there is emptyneſs to ſpare. 'Tis certain, though the Women ſeldom find that out; for though they do not ſee ſo much in a Man as was promiſed, yet they will be ſo kind to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine he has ſome hidden excellencies which time may diſcover to them, ſo are content to allow him a conſiderable ſhare of their eſteem, and take him into Favour upon Tick. <hi>Aurelian</hi> as he had good Credit, ſo he had a good Stock to ſupport it, and his Perſon was a good promiſing Security for the payment of any Obligation he could lie under to the Fair Sex.
<hi>Hippolito,</hi> who at this time was our <hi>Aurelian,</hi> did not at all leſſen him in appearing for him: So that although <hi>Leonora</hi> was indeed miſtaken, ſhe could not be ſaid to be much in the wrong. I could find in my Heart to beg the Reader's pardon for this Digreſſion, if I thought he would be ſenſible of the Civility; for I promiſe him, I do not intend to do it again throughout the Story, though I make never ſo many, and though he take them never ſo ill. But becauſe I began this upon a bare Suppoſition of his Impertinence, which might be ſomewhat impertinent in me to ſuppoſe I do, and hope to make him amends by telling him, that by the time <hi>Leonora</hi> was dreſs'd, ſeveral Ladies of her acquaintance came to accompany her to the place deſigned for the Tilting, where we will leave
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:135663:162"/> them drinking Chocholate till 'tis time for them to go.</p>
                  <p>Our Cavaliers had by good Fortune provided themſelves of two curious Suits of light Armour, finely enammelled and gilt. <hi>Hippolito</hi> had ſent to <hi>Poggio Imperiale</hi> for a couple of fine led Horſes which he had left there with the reſt of his Train at his entrance into
<hi>Florence.</hi> Mounted on theſe and every way well Equipt, they took their way, attended only by two Lacqueys, toward the Church <hi>di Santa Croce,</hi> before which they were to perform their Exerciſes of Chivalry. <hi>Hippolito</hi> wore upon his Helm a large Plume of Crimſon Feathers, in the midſt of which was artificially placed <hi>Leonora</hi>'s Handkerchief. His Armour was gilt, and enammell'd with Green and Crimſon. <hi>Aurelian</hi> was not ſo happy as to wear any token to recommend him to the notice of his Miſtreſs, ſo had only a Plume of Sky-colour and White Feathers, ſuitable to his Armour, which was Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enammelled with Azure. I ſhall not deſcribe the Habits of any other Cavaliers, or of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; let it ſuffice to tell the Reader they were all very Fine and very Glorious, and let him dreſs them in what is moſt agreeable to his own Fancy.</p>
                  <p>Our Gallants entred the Liſts, and having made their Obeyſance to his Highneſs, turned round to ſalute and view the Company. The Scaffold was circular, ſo that there was no end of the Delightful Proſpect. It ſeem'd a Glory of Beauty which ſhone around the admiring Behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Our Lovers ſoon perceived the Stars which were to Rule their Deſtiny, which ſparkled a Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre beyond all the Inferiour Conſtellations, and ſeem'd like two Suns to diſtribute Light to all
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:135663:162"/> the Planets in that Heavenly Sphere. <hi>Leonora</hi> knew her Slave by his Badge, and bluſhed till the Lillies and Roſes in her Cheeks had reſemblance to the Plume of Crimſon and White Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief in <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Chreſt. He made her a low Bow, and reined his Horſe back with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Grace, into a reſpectful Retreat.
<hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> ſaw his Angel, his beautiful <hi>Incognita,</hi> and had no other way to make himſelf known to her, but by ſaluting and bowing to her after the Spaniſh Mode; ſhe gueſs'd him by it to be her new Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Hippolito,</hi> and ſignified her Apprehenſion, by making him a more particular and obliging return, than to any of the Cavaliers who had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted her before.</p>
                  <p>The Exerciſe that was to be perform'd was in general a running at the Ring; and afterwards two Cavaliers undertook to defend the Beauty of <hi>Donna Catharina,</hi> againſt all who would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her Preheminence of their Miſtreſſes. This thing was only deſigned for Shew and Form, none preſuming that any Body would put ſo great an Affront upon the Bride and Duke's Kinſwoman, as to diſpute her Pretentions to the firſt place in the Court of <hi>Venus.</hi> But here our Cavaliers were under a Miſtake; for ſeeing a large Shield carried before two Knights, with a Lady painted upon it; not knowing who, but reading the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription which was (in large Gold Letters) <hi>Above the Inſolence of Competition.</hi> They thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged, eſpecially in the Preſence of their Miſtreſſes, to vindicate their Beauty; and were juſt ſpurring on to engage the Champions, when a Gentleman ſtopping them, told them their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, that it was the Picture of <hi>Donna Catharina,</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:135663:163"/> and a particular Honour done to her by his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's Commands, and not to be diſputed. Upon this they would have returned to their Poſt, much concerned for their Miſtake; but notice being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> of ſome Show of Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was made, he would have begged leave of the Duke, to have maintained his Lady's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour againſt thoſe Cavaliers; but the Duke would by no means permit it. They were arguing about it when one of them came up, before whom the Shield was born, and demanded his Highneſs's Permiſſion, to inform thoſe Gentlemen better of their Miſtake, by giving them the Foyl. By the Interceſſion of <hi>Don Ferdinand,</hi> leave was given them; whereupon a Civil Challenge was ſent to the two Strangers, informing them of their Error, and withal telling them they muſt either maintain it by force of Arms, or make a publick Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment by riding Bare-headed before the Picture once round the Liſts. The Stranger-Cavaliers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated to the Duke how ſenſible they were of their Error; and though they would not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it, yet they could not decline the Combat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſſed to it beyond an honourable Refuſal. To the Bride they ſent a Complement, wherein, having firſt begg'd her Pardon for not knowing her Picture, they gave her to underſtand, that now they were not about to diſpute her undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Right to the Crown of Beauty, but the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being her Champions was the Prize they ſought for, which they thought themſelves as able to maintain as any other Pretenders. Wherefore they pray'd her, that if Fortune ſo far befriended their Endeavours as to make them Victors, that they might receive no other Reward, but to be
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:135663:163"/> crown'd with the Titles of their Adverſaries, and be ever after eſteem'd as her moſt humble Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. The Excuſe was ſo handſomly deſigned, and much better expreſs'd than 'tis here, that it took effect. The Duke, <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> and his Lady, were ſo well ſatisfied with it as to grant their Requeſt.</p>
                  <p>While the running at the Ring laſted, our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers alternately bore away great ſhare of the Honour. That Sport ended, Marſhals were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Field, and every thing in great Form ſettled for the Combat. The Cavaliers were all in good earneſt, but Orders were given to bring 'em blunted Lances, and to forbid the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Sword upon pain of his Highneſs's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. The Trumpets ſounded, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan their Courſe. The Ladies Hearts, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the <hi>Incognita</hi> and <hi>Leonora</hi>'s, beat time to the Horſes Hoofs, and Hope and Fear made a mock Fight within their tender Breaſt, each wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and doubting Succeſs where ſhe lik'd: But as the generality of their Prayers were for the grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Strangers, they accordingly ſucceeded. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi>'s Adverſary was unhorſed in the firſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, and <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s loſt both his Stirrops and dropt his Lance to ſave himſelf. The Honour of the Field was immediately granted to them, and <hi>Donna Catherina</hi> ſent them both Favours, which ſhe pray'd them to wear as her Knights. The Crowd breaking up, our Cavaliers made a ſhift to ſteal off unmarked, ſave by the watchful <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora</hi> and
<hi>Incognita,</hi> whoſe Eyes were never off from their reſpective Servants. There was enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry made for them, but to no purpoſe; for they, to prevent their being diſcovered, had prepared
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:135663:164"/> another Houſe, diſtant from their Lodging, where a Servant attended to diſarm them, and another carried back their Horſes to the <hi>Villa,</hi> while they walked unſuſpected to their Lodging; but <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognita</hi> had given Command to a Page to dog 'em till the Evening, at a diſtance, and bring her word where they were lateſt houſed.</p>
                  <p>While ſeveral Conjectures paſs'd among the Company, who were all gone to Dinner at the Palace, who thoſe Cavaliers ſhould be, <hi>Don Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bio</hi> thought himſelf the only Man able to gueſs; for he knew for certain that his Son and <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lito</hi> were both in Town, as was well enough plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with his humour of remaining <hi>Incognito</hi> till the Diverſions ſhould be over, believing then that the ſurprize of his Diſcovery would add much to the Gallantry he had ſhown in Maſquerade; but hearing the extraordinary liking that every body expreſs'd, and in a particular manner, the great Duke himſelf, to the Perſons and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the unknown Cavaliers, the Old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man could not forbear the Vanity to tell his Highneſs, that he believed he had an intereſt in one of the Gentlemen, whom he was pleaſed to honour with ſo favourable a Character; and told him what reaſon he had to believe the one to be his Son, and the other a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nobleman, his Friend.</p>
                  <p>This diſcovery having thus got vent, was dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed like Air; every body ſuck'd it in, and let it out again with their Breath to the next they met withal; and in half an hours time it was talked of in the Houſe where our Adventurers were lodged. <hi>Aurelian</hi> was ſtark mad at the News, and knew what ſearch would be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:135663:164"/> made for him. <hi>Hippolito,</hi> had he not been deſperately in Love, would certainly have taken Horſe and rid out of Town juſt then; for he could make no longer doubt of being diſcovered, and he was afraid of the juſt Exceptions <hi>Leonora</hi> might make to a Perſon who had now deceived her twice. Well, we will leave them both fretting and contriving to no purpoſe, to look about and ſee what was done at the Palace, where their doom was determined much quicker than they imagined.</p>
                  <p>Dinner ended, the Duke retired with ſome cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Friends to a Glaſs of Wine; among whom were the Marqueſs of <hi>Viterbo</hi> and <hi>Don Fabio.</hi> His Highneſs was no Stranger to the long Fewd that had been between the two Families, and alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood what Overtures of Reconciliation had been lately made, with the Propoſals of Marriage between <hi>Aurelian</hi> and the Marqueſs's Daughter. Having waited till the Wine had taken the effect propoſed, and the Company were raiſed to an uncommon pitch of Chearfulneſs, which he alſo encouraged by an Example of Freedom and good Humour, he took an Opportunity of rallying the two grave Signiors into an Accommodation: That was ſeconded with the Praiſes of the Young Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the whole Company joined in a large Encomium upon the Graces of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> and the the Beauties of
<hi>Juliana.</hi> The old Fellows were tickled with Delight to hear their Darlings ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, which the Duke perceiving, out of a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Generoſity and Friendſhip, urged the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Conſummation of the Marriage; telling them there was yet one Day of publick Rejoycing to come, and how glad he ſhould be to have it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:135663:165"/> by ſo acceptable an Alliance; and what an Honour it would be to have his Couſin's Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage attended by the Conjunction of ſo extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary a Pair, the performance of which Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony would crown the Joy that was then in Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and make the laſt Day vie for equal Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Happineſs with the firſt. In ſhort, by the Complaiſant and Perſwaſive Authority of the Duke, the <hi>Dons</hi> were wrought into a Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and accordingly embraced and ſhook Hands upon the matter. This News was diſperſed like the former, and <hi>Don Fabio</hi> gave Orders for the enquiring out his Son's Lodgings, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs and he might make him a Viſit, as ſoon as he had acquainted <hi>Juliana</hi> with his purpoſe, that ſhe might prepare her ſelf. He found her very chearful with <hi>Donna Catherina,</hi> and ſeveral other Ladies: Whereupon the Old Gentleman, pretty well warmed with the Dukes good Fellowſhip, told her aloud, He was come to Crown their Mirth with another Wedding; that his Highneſs had been pleaſed to provide a Husband for his Daughter, and he would have her provide her ſelf to receive him to morrow. All the Company at firſt, as well as <hi>Juliana</hi> her ſelf, thought he had rally'd, till the Duke coming in confirm'd the ſerious part of his Diſcourſe.
<hi>Juliana</hi> was confounded at the Haſte that was impoſed on her, and deſired a little time to conſider what ſhe was about. But the Marqueſs told her, She ſhould have all the reſt of her Life to conſider in; that <hi>Aurelian</hi> ſhould come and conſider with her in the Morning, if ſhe pleaſed; but in the mean time, he adviſed her to go home and call her Maids to Counſel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:135663:165"/>
                     <hi>Juliana</hi> took her leave of the Company very gravely, as if not much delighted with her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Raillery. <hi>Leonora</hi> happened to be by, and heard all that paſſed; ſhe was ready to ſwoon, and found her ſelf ſeized with a more violent Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion than ever for <hi>Aurelian:</hi> Now upon her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of loſing him, her active fancy had brought him before her with all the advantages imaginable, and though ſhe had before found great tenderneſs in her Inclination toward him, yet was ſhe ſomewhat ſurprized to find ſhe really lov'd him. She was ſo uneaſie at what ſhe had heard, that ſhe thought it convenient to ſteal out of the preſence, and retire to her Cloſet, to bemoan her unhappy helpleſs Condition.</p>
                  <p>Our Two Cavalier-Lovers had rack'd their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention till it was quite diſabled, and could not make diſcovery of one Contrivance more for their Relief. Both ſat ſilent, each depending upon his Friend, and ſtill expecting when t'other ſhould ſpeak. Night came upon them while they ſate thus thoughtleſs, or rather drowned in Thought; but a Servant bringing Lights into the Room a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened them: And <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Speech, uſher'd by a profound Sigh, broke Silence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="inline">Well! (ſaid he) what muſt we do, <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian?</hi> We muſt ſuffer, replied <hi>Aurelian</hi> faintly. When immediately raiſing his Voice, he cry'd out, Oh ye unequal Powers, why do ye urge us to deſire what ye doom us to forbear; give us a Will to chuſe, then curb us with a Duty to reſtrain that Choice! Cruel Father, Will no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe ſuffice! Am I to be the Sacrifice to expiate your Offences paſt; paſt ere I was born? Were I to loſe my Life, I'd gladly Seal
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:135663:166"/> your Reconcilement with my Blood. But Oh my Soul is free; you have no Title to my Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Being, that has Exiſtence independent of your Power; and muſt I loſe my Love, the Extract of that Being, the Joy, Light, Life, and Darling of my Soul? No, I'll own my Flame, and plead my Title too.— But hold, wretched <hi>Aurelian,</hi> hold, whither does thy Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion hurry thee? Alas! the cruel fair <hi>Incognita</hi> Loves thee not! She knows not of thy Love! If ſhe did, what Merit haſt thou to pretend? — Only Love.— Exceſs of Love. And all the World has that. All that have ſeen her. Yet I had only ſeen her once, and in that once I lov'd above the World; nay, lov'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my ſelf, ſuch vigorous Flame, ſo ſtrong, ſo quick ſhe darted at my Breaſt; it muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, and by Reflection, warm her ſelf. Ah! welcome Thought, lovely deluding Fancy, hang ſtill upon my Soul, let me but think, that once ſhe Loves, and periſh my Deſpair.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here a ſuddain ſtop gave a Period alſo to <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi>'s Expectation, and he hoped now that his Friend had given his Paſſion ſo free a vent, he might recollect and bethink himſelf of what was convenient to be done; but <hi>Aurelian,</hi> as if he had muſtered up all his Spirits purely to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit himſelf of that paſſionate Harangue, ſtood mute and inſenſible like an Alarum Clock, that had ſpent all its force in one violent Emotion.
<hi>Hippolito</hi> ſhook him by the Arm to rouze him from his Lithargy, when his Lacquey coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Room, out of Breath, told him there was a Coach juſt ſtopp'd at the Door, but he did not take time to ſee who came in it. <hi>Aurelian,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:135663:166"/> immediately it was his Father in queſt of him; and without ſaying any more to <hi>Hippolito,</hi> than that he was Ruined if diſcovered, took his Sword and ſlipp'd down a back pair of Stairs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Garden, from whence he conveyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the Street.
<hi>Hippolito</hi> had not bethought himſelf what to do, before he perceiv'd a Lady come into the Chamber cloſe veil'd, and make toward him. At the firſt appearance of a Woman, his Imagination flattered him with a Thought of <hi>Leonora;</hi> but that was quickly over upon near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Approach to the Lady, who had much the Advantage in Stature of his Miſtreſs. He very civilly accoſted her, and asked, if he were the Perſon to whom the Honour of that Viſit was intended. She ſaid, her Buſineſs was with <hi>Don Hippolito di Saviolina,</hi> to whom ſhe had Matter of Concern to import, and which required haſte. He had like to have told her, That he was the Man, but by good Chance reflecting upon his Friend's Adventure, who had taken his name, he made Anſwer, that he believed <hi>Don Hippolito</hi> not far off, and if ſhe had a Moment's Patience he would enquire for him.</p>
                  <p>He went out, leaving the Lady in the Room, and made ſearch all round the Houſe and Garden for <hi>Aurelian,</hi> but to no purpoſe. The Lady, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of his long ſtay, took a Pen and Ink and ſome Paper which ſhe found upon the Table, and had juſt made an End of her Letter, when hearing a Noiſe of more than one coming up Stairs, ſhe concluded his Friend had found him, and that her Letter would be to no purpoſe, ſo tore it in pieces, which ſhe repented; when turning about, ſhe found her miſtake, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:135663:167"/> 
                     <hi>Don Fobio</hi> and the Marqueſs of <hi>Viterbo</hi> juſt entering at the Door. She gave a Shriek at the Surprize of their Appearance, which much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Old Gentlemen, and made them retire in Confuſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for putting a Gentlewoman into ſuch a Fright. The Marqueſs thinking they had been miſ-informed, or had miſtaken the Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, came forward again, and made an Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to the Lady for their Errour; but ſhe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no reply, walk'd directly by him down Stairs and went into her Coach, which hurried her away as ſpeedily as the Horſes were able to draw.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dons</hi> were at a loſs what to think, when, <hi>Hippolito</hi> coming into the Room to give the Lady an Account of his Errant, was no leſs aſtoniſhed to find ſhe was departed, and had left Two Old Signiors in her ſtead. He knew <hi>Don Fabio</hi>'s Face, for
<hi>Aurelian</hi> had ſhewn him his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the Tilting; but being confident he was not known to him, he ventur'd to ask him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Lady whom juſt now he had left in that Chamber.
<hi>Don Fabio</hi> told him, ſhe was juſt gone down, and doubted they had been Guilty of a Miſtake, in coming to enquire for a Couple of Gentlemen whom they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed were Lodged in that Houſe; he begg'd his Pardon if he had any Relation to that Lady, and deſired to know if he could give them any Account of the Perſons they ſought for. <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi> made anſwer, He was a Stranger in the Place, and only a Servant to that Lady whom they had diſturb'd, and whom he muſt go and ſeek out. And in this Perplexity he left them
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:135663:167"/> going again in ſearch of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> to inform him of what had paſſed.</p>
                  <p>The Old Gentlemen at laſt meeting with a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Houſe, were directed to Signior
<hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio</hi>'s Chamber, where they were no ſooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, but <hi>Aurelian</hi> came into the Houſe. A Servant who had skulk'd for him by <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Order, followed him up into the Chamber, and told him who was with <hi>Claudio</hi> then making En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry for him. He thought that to be no Place for him, ſince <hi>Claudio</hi> muſt needs diſcover all the Truth to his Father; wherefore he left Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with the Servant, where <hi>Hippolito</hi> ſhould meet him in the Morning. As he was going out of the Room he eſpied a torn Paper, which the Lady had thrown upon the Floor: The firſt piece he took up had <hi>Incognita</hi> written upon it; the ſight of which ſo Alarum'd him, he ſcarce knew what he was about; but hearing a Noiſe of a Door opening over Head, with as much Care as was conſiſtent with the haſte he was then in, he gathered up the ſcattered pieces of Paper, and betook himſelf to a Ramble.</p>
                  <p>Coming by a Light which hung at the Corner of a Street, he join'd the torn Papers and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected thus much, that his <hi>Incognita</hi> had Written the Note, and earneſtly deſired him (if there were any reality in what he pretended to her) to meet her at Twelve a Clock that Night at a Convent Gate; but unluckily the Bit of Paper which ſhould have mentioned what Convent, was broken off and loſt.</p>
                  <p>Here was a large Subject for <hi>Aurelian</hi>'s Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which he did not ſpare to pour forth in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Curſes on his Stars. So earneſt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:135663:168"/> was he in the Contemplation of his Misfortunes, that he walk'd on unwittingly; till at length a Silence (and ſuch as was only to be found in that part of the Town, whither his unguided Steps had carried him) ſurpriz'd his Attention. I ſay, a profound Silence rouzed him from his Thought; and a clap of Thunder could have done no more.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe it is poſſible this at ſome time or other may happen to be read by ſome Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or Ignorant Perſon, (no Reflection upon the preſent Reader) who will not admit, or does not underſtand that Silence ſhould make a Man ſtart; and have the ſame Effect, in provoking his Attention, with its oppoſite Noiſe; I will illuſtrate this Matter, to ſuch a diminutive Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, by a Parallel inſtance of Light; which though it does chiefly entertain the Eyes, and is indeed the prime Object of the Sight, yet ſhould it immediately ceaſe, to have a Man left in the Dark by a ſuddain deficiency of it, would make him ſtare with his Eyes, and though he could not ſee, endeavour to look about him. Why juſt thus did it fare with our Adventurer; who ſeeming to have wandred both into the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of Silence and of Night, began to have ſome tender for his own Safety, and would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have groped his Way back again; when he heard a Voice, as from a Perſon whoſe Breath had been ſtopp'd by ſome forcible Oppreſſion, and juſt then, by a violent Effort, was broke through the Reſtraint.—
<q rend="inline">Yet — Yet — (again reply'd the Voice, ſtill ſtruggling for Air,) Forbear— and I'll forgive what's paſt— I have done nothing yet that needs a Pardon,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:135663:168"/> (ſays another) and what is to come, will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of none.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Perſon who ſeemed to be Oppreſſed, made ſeveral Attempts to ſpeak, but they were only inarticulate Sounds, being all interrupted and choaked in their Paſſage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aurelian</hi> was ſufficiently aſtoniſh'd, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> would have crept nearer to the Place whence he gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Voice to come; but he was got among the Ruines of an Old Monaſtery, and could not ſtir ſo ſilently; but ſome looſe Stones he met with made a rumbling. The Noiſe alarm'd both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and as it gave Comfort to the one, it ſo Terrified the t'other, that he could not hinder the Oppreſſed from calling for help. <hi>Aurelian</hi> fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy'd it was a Womans Voice, and immediately drawing his Sword demanded what was the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; he was anſwered with the Appearance of a Man, who had opened a Dark Lanthorn which he had by him, and came toward him with a Piſtol in his Hand ready cock'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aurelian</hi> ſeeing the irreſiſtable advantage his Adverſary had over him, would fain have retired; and, by the greateſt Providence in the World, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backwards fell down over ſome looſe Stones that lay in his Way, juſt in that Inſtant of Time when the Villain fired his Piſtol, who ſeeing him fall, concluded he had Shot him. The Crys of the afflicted Perſon were redoubled at the Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sight, which made the Murderer, drawing a Poniard, to threaten him, that the next Murmur ſhould be his laſt. <hi>Aurelian,</hi> who was ſcarce aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that he was unhurt, got ſoftly up; and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming near enough to perceive the Violence that was uſed to ſtop the Injured Man's Mouth; (for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:135663:169"/> now he ſaw plainly it was a Man) cry'd out, — Turn, Villain, and look upon thy Death— The Fellow amazed at the Voice, turn'd about to have ſnatch'd up the Lanthorn from the Ground either to have given Light only to himſelf, or to have put out the Candle, that he might have made his Eſcape; but which of the Two he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, no Body could tell but himſelf: And if the Reader have a Curioſity to know, he muſt blame
<hi>Aurelian;</hi> who thinking there could be no foul Play offered to ſuch a Villain, ran him immediately through the Heart, ſo that he drop'd down Dead at his Feet, without ſpeaking a Word. He would have ſeen who the Perſon was he had thus happily delivered, but the Dead Body had fallen upon the Lanthorn, which put out the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle: However, coming up toward him, he ask'd him how he did, and bid him be of good Heart; he was anſwered with nothing but Prayers, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and Thanks, called a Thouſand Deliverers, good Genius's and Guardian Angels. And the Reſcued would certainly have gone upon his Knees to have worſhipped him, had he not been bound Hand and Foot; which <hi>Aurelian</hi> underſtanding, groped for the Knots, and either untied them or cut them aſunder; but 'tis more probable the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe more expeditious.</p>
                  <p>They took little heed what became of the Body which they left behind them, and <hi>Aurelian</hi> was conducted from out the Ruins by the Hand of him he had delivered. By a faint light iſſuing from the juſt riſing Moon, he could diſcern that it was a Youth; but coming into a more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed part of the Town, where ſeveral Lights were hung out, he was amaz'd at the extream Beauty
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:135663:169"/> which appeared in his Face, though a little pale and diſordered with his late fright. <hi>Aurelian</hi> longed to hear the Story of ſo odd an adventure, and entreated his Charge to tell it him by the way; but he deſired him to forbear till they were come into ſome Houſe or other, where he might reſt and recover his tired Spirits, for yet he was ſo faint he was unable to look up. <hi>Aurelian</hi> thought theſe laſt words were delivered in a Voice, whoſe accent was not new to him. That thought made him look earneſtly in the Youth's Face, which he now was ſure he had ſomewhere ſeen before, and thereupon asked him if he had never been at <hi>Siena!</hi> That Queſtion made the young Gentleman look up, and ſomething of a Joy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in his Countenance, which yet he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſmother; ſo praying
<hi>Aurelian</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him to his Lodging, he promiſed him that as ſoon as they ſhould come thither, he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with any thing he deſired to know. <hi>Aurelian</hi> would rather have gone any where elſe than to his own Lodging; but being ſo very late, he was at a loſs, and ſo forced to be contented.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as they were come into his Chamber, and that Lights were brought them, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant diſmiſſed, the paleneſs which ſo viſibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had uſurped the ſweet Countenance of the afflicted Youth vaniſhed, and gave place to a more lively Flood of Crimſon, which with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt heat glow'd freſhly on his Cheeks. <hi>Aurelian</hi> waited with a pleaſing Admiration the diſcovery promiſed him, when the Youth ſtill ſtruggling with his Reſolution, with a timorous haſte, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led off a Peruke which had concealed the moſt
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:135663:170"/> beautiful abundance of Hair that ever graced-one Female Head; thoſe diſhevelled ſpreading Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as at firſt they made a diſcovery of, ſo at laſt they ſerved for a veil to the modeſt lovely bluſhes of the fair <hi>Incognita;</hi> for ſhe it was and none other. But Oh! the inexpreſſible, inconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble joy and amazement of
<hi>Aurelian!</hi> As ſoon as he durſt venture to think, he concluded it to be all Viſion, and never doubted ſo much of any thing in his Life as if his being then awake. But ſhe taking him by the Hand, and deſiring him to ſit down by her, partly convinced him of the reality of her preſence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="inline">This is the ſecond time, <hi>Don Hippolito,</hi> (ſaid ſhe to him) that I have been here this Night. What the occaſion was of my ſeeking you out, and how by miracle you preſerved me, would add too much to the ſurprize I perceive you to be already in ſhould I tell you: Nor will I make any further diſcovery, till I know what cenſure you paſs upon the confidence which I have put in you, and the ſtrange Circumſtances in which you find me at this time. I am ſenſible they are ſuch, that I ſhall not blame your ſevereſt Conjectures; but I hope to convince you, when you ſhall hear what I have to ſay in juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my Vertue.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Juſtification! (cry'd <hi>Aurelian</hi>) what Infidel dares doubt it!— Then kneeling down, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her Hand,
<q rend="inline">Ah Madam (ſays he) would Heaven would no other ways look upon, than I behold your Perfections— Wrong not your Creature with a Thought, he can be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that horrid Impiety as once to doubt your Vertue.— Heaven! (cry'd he, ſtarting up) am
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:135663:170"/> I ſo really bleſſed to ſee you once again! May I truſt my Sight?— Or does my fancy now only more ſtrongly work?— For ſtill I did preſerve your Image in my Heart, and you were ever preſent to my deareſt Thoughts.—</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="inline">Enough <hi>Hippolito,</hi> enough of Rapture (ſaid ſhe) you cannot much accuſe me of Ingratitude; for you ſee I have not been unmindful of you; but moderate your Joy till I have told you my Condition, and if for my ſake you are raiſed to this Delight, it is not of a long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.—</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>At that (as <hi>Aurelian</hi> tells the Story) a Sigh diffuſed a mournful ſweetneſs through the Air, and liquid grief fell gently from her Eyes, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant ſadneſs ſat upon her Brow, and even ſorrow ſeem'd delighted with the Conqueſt he had made. See what a change
<hi>Aurelian</hi> felt! His heart bled Tears, and trembled in his Breaſt; Sighs ſtruggling for a vent had choacked each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers paſſage up: His Floods of Joys were all ſuppreſt; cold doubts and fears had chill'd 'em with a ſudden Froſt, and he was troubled to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; yet knew not why. Well, the Learned ſay it was Sympathy; and I am always of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Learned, if they ſpeak firſt.</p>
                  <p>After a World of Condoleance had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, he prevailed with her to tell him her Story. So having put all her Sighs into one great Sigh, ſhe diſcharged her ſelf of 'em all at once, and formed the Relation you are juſt about to Read.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="inline">Having been in my Infancy Contracted to a Man I could never endure, and now by my Parents being likely to be forced to Marry him,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:135663:171"/> is in ſhort, the great occaſion of my grief. I fanſy'd (continued ſhe) ſomething ſo Generous in your Countenance, and uncommon in your Behaviour, while you were diverting your ſelf, and rallying me with Expreſſions of Gallantry, at the Ball as induced me to hold Conference with you. I now freely confeſs'd to you, out of deſign, That if things ſhould happen as I then feared, and as now they are come to paſs, I might rely upon your Aſſiſtance in a matter of Concern; and in which I would ſooner chuſe to depend upon a generous Stranger, than any Acquaintance I have. What Mirth and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom I then put on, were, I can aſſure you, far diſtant from my Heart; but I did violence to my ſelf out of Complaiſance to your Temper. — I knew you at the Tilting, and wiſhed you might come off as you did; though I do not doubt, but you would have had as good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs had it been oppoſite to my Inclinations.— Not to detain you by too tedious a Relation, every day my Friends urged me to the Match they had agreed upon for me, before I was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Conſenting; at laſt their importunities grew to that degree, that I found I muſt either conſent, which would make me miſerable, or be miſerable by perpetually enduring to be baited by my Father, Brother, and other Relations. I reſolved yeſterday, on a ſuddain, to give firm Faith to the Opinion I had conceived of you; and accordingly came in the Evening to requeſt your aſſiſtance, in delivering me from my Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors, by a ſafe and private conveyance of me to a Monaſtery about four Leagues hence, where I have an Aunt who will receive me, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:135663:171"/> is the only Relation I have averſe to the Match. I was ſurprized at the appearance of ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany I did not expect at your Lodgings; which made me in haſte tear a Paper which I had written to you with Directions where to find me, and get ſpeedily away in my Coach to an old Servant's Houſe, whom I acquainted with my purpoſe: By my Order ſhe provided me of this Habit which I now wear; I ventured to truſt my ſelf with her Brother, and reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go under his Conduct to the Monaſtery; he proved to be a Villain, and pretending to take me a ſhort and private way to the place where he was to take up a Hackney Coach (for that which I came in was broke ſomewhere or other, with the haſte it made to carry me from your Lodging) led me into an old ruined Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, where it pleaſed Heaven, by what Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident I know not, to direct you. I need not tell you how you ſaved my Life and my Honour by revenging me with the Death of my Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Guide. This is the ſumm of my preſent Condition, bating the apprehenſions I am in of being taken by ſome of my Relations, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a thing ſo quite contrary to my Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aurelian</hi> was confounded at the Relation ſhe had made, and began to fear his own Eſtate to be more deſperate than ever he had imagined. He made her a very Paſſionate and Eloquent Speech in behalf of himſelf (much better than I intend to inſert here) and expreſſed a mighty concern that ſhe ſhould look upon his ardent Affection to be only Rallery or Gallantry. He was very free of his Oaths to confirm the Truth of what he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:135663:172"/> nor I believe did ſhe doubt it, or at leaſt was unwilling ſo to do: For I would Caution the the Reader by the bye, nor to believe every word which ſhe told him, not that admirable ſorrow which ſhe counterfeited to be accurately true. It was indeed truth ſo cunningly intermingled with Fiction, that it required no leſs Wit and Preſence of Mind than ſhe was endowed with ſo to acquit her ſelf on the ſuddain. She had entruſted her ſelf indeed with a Fellow who proved a Villain, to conduct her to a Monaſtery; but one which was in the Town, and where ſhe intended only to lie concealed for his ſake; as the Reader ſhall underſtand ere long: For we have another Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very to make to him, if he have not found it out of himſelf already.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Aurelian</hi> had ſaid what he was able upon the Subject in hand, with a mournful tone and dejected look, he demanded his Doom. She ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him if he would endeavour to convey her to the Monaſtery ſhe had told him of;
<q rend="inline">Your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, Madam, (replied he) are Sacred to me; and were they to lay down my Life I would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them.</q> With that he would have gone out of the Room, to have given order for his Horſes to be got ready immediately; but with a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſo full of ſorrow as moved Compaſſion in the tender hearted <hi>Incognita.</hi>
                     <q rend="inline">Stay a little <hi>Don Hippolito</hi> (ſaid ſhe) I fear I ſhall not be able to undergo the Fatigue of a Journey, this Night. —Stay and give me your Advice how I ſhall conceal my ſelf if I continue to morrow in this Town.</q> 
                     <hi>Aurelian</hi> could have ſatisfied her ſhe was not then in a place to avoid diſcovery: But he muſt alſo have told her then the reaſon of it,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:135663:172"/> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> whom he was, and who were in queſt of him, which he did not think convenient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare till neceſſity ſhould urge him; for he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leaſt her knowledge of thoſe-deſigns which were in agitation between him and <hi>Juliana,</hi> might deter her more from giving her conſent. At laſt he reſolved to try his utmoſt perſwaſions to gain her, and told her accordingly, he was afraid ſhe would be diſturbed there in the Morning, and he knew no other way (if ſhe had not as great an averſion for him as the Man whom ſhe now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to avoid) than by making him happy to make her ſelf ſecure. He demonſtrated to her, that the diſobligation to her Parents would be greater by going to a Monaſtery, ſince it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to avoid a choice which they had made for her, and which ſhe could not have ſo juſt a pretence to do till ſhe had made one for her ſelf.</p>
                  <p>A World of other Arguments he uſed, which ſhe contradicted as long as ſhe was able, or at leaſt willing. At laſt ſhe told him, ſhe would conſult her Pillow, and in the Morning conclude what was fit to be done. He thought it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to leave her to her reſt, and having lock'd her up in his Room, went himſelf to repoſe upon a Pallat by Signior
<hi>Claudio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time, it may be convenient to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what became of <hi>Hippolito.</hi> He had wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much in purſuit of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> though <hi>Leonora</hi> equally took up his Thoughts; He was reflecting upon the oddneſs and extravagance of his Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the Continuation of which had doubtleſs created in him a great uneaſineſs, when it was interrupted with the noiſe of opening the Gates of the Convent of St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> whither he was
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:135663:173"/> arrived ſooner than he thought for, being the place <hi>Aurelian</hi> had appointed by the Lacquey to meet him in. He wondered to ſee the Gates opened at ſo unſeaſonable an hour, and went to enquire the reaſon of it from them who were employ'd; but they proved to be Novices, and made him ſigns to go in, where he might meet with ſome body allow'd to anſwer hm. He found the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Men all up, and Tapers lighting every where: at laſt he follow'd a Friar who was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Garden, and asking him the cauſe of theſe Preparations, he was anſwered, That they were entreated to pray for the Soul of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, who was juſt departing or departed this Life, and whom upon farther talk with him, he found to be the ſame <hi>Lorenzo</hi> ſo often mentioned. <hi>Don Mario,</hi> it ſeems Uncle to
<hi>Lorenzo</hi> and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Leonora,</hi> had a private Door out of the Garden, belonging to his Houſe into that of the Convent, which Door this Father was now a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to open, that he and his Family might come and offer up their Oraiſons for the Soul of their Kinſman.
<hi>Hippolito</hi> having informed himſelf of as much as he could ask without ſuſpicion, took his leave of the Friar, not a little joyful at the Hopes he had by ſuch unexpected Means, of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Beautiful <hi>Leonora:</hi> As ſoon as he was got at convenient Diſtance from the Friar, (who 'tis like thought he had return'd into the Convent to his Devotion) he returned back through a cloſe Walk which led him with a little Compaſs, to the ſame private Door, where juſt before he had left the Friar, who now he ſaw was gone, and the Door open.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:135663:173"/>He went into <hi>Don Mario</hi>'s Garden, and walk'd round with much Caution and Circumſpection; for the Moon was then about to riſe, and had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diffuſed a glimmering Light, ſufficient to diſtinguiſh a Man from a Tree. By Computation now (which is a very remarkable Circumſtance) <hi>Hippolito</hi> entred this Garden near upon the ſame Inſtant, when <hi>Aurelian</hi> wandred into the Old Monaſtery and found his <hi>Incognita</hi> in Diſtreſs. He was pretty well acquainted with the Platform, and Sight of the Garden; for he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurveyed the Outſide, and knew what part to make to if he ſhould be ſurpriz'd and driven to a precipitate Eſcape. He took his Stand behind a well-grown Buſh of Myrtle, which, ſhould the Moon ſhine brighter than was required, had the Advantage to be ſhaded by the Indulgent Boughs of an ancient Bay-Tree. He was delighted with the Choice he had made, for he found a Hallow in the Myrtle, as if purpoſely contriv'd for the Reception of one Perſon, who might undiſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perceive all about him. He looked upon it as a good Omen, that the Tree Conſecrated to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> was ſo propitious to him in his Amorous Diſtreſs. The Conſideration of that, together with the Obligation he lay under to the Muſes, for ſheltering him alſo with ſo large a Crown of Bays, had like to have ſet him a Rhyming.</p>
                  <p>He was, to tell the Truth, naturally addicted to <hi>Madrigal,</hi> and we ſhould undoubtedly have had a ſmall deſert of Numbers to have pick'd and Criticiz'd upon, had he not been interrupted juſt upon his Delivery; nay, after the Prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Sigh had made Way for his Utterance. But ſo was his Fortune, <hi>Don Mario</hi> was coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:135663:174"/> the Door at that very nick of Time, where he met with a Prieſt juſt out of Breath, who told him that <hi>Lorenzo</hi> was juſt breathing his laſt, and deſired to know if he would come and take his final Leave before they were to adminiſter the Extream Unction. <hi>Don Mario,</hi> who had been at ſome Difference with his Nephew, now thought it his Duty to be Reconciled to him; ſo calling to <hi>Leonora,</hi> who was coming after him, he bid her go to her Devotions in the Chappel, and told her where he was going.</p>
                  <p>He went on with the Prieſt, while <hi>Hippolito</hi> ſaw <hi>Leonora</hi> come forward, only accompanied by her Woman. She was in an undreſs, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a Melancholy viſible in her Face, more Careleſs than uſual in her Attire, which he thought added as much as was poſſible to the abundance of her Charms. He had not much Time to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template this Beauteous Viſion, for ſhe ſoon paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into the Garden of the Convent, leaving him Confounded with Love, Admiration, Joy, Hope, Fear, and all the Train of Paſſions, which ſeize upon Men in his Condition, all at once. He was ſo teazed with this Variety of Torment, that he never miſſed the Two Hours that had ſlipped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way during his Automachy and Inteſtine Conflict.
<hi>Leonora</hi>'s Return ſettled his Spirits, at leaſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, and he had now no other Thought but how he ſhould preſent himſelf before her. When ſhe calling her Woman, bid her bolt the Garden Door on the Inſide, that ſhe might not be Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd by her Father, if he returned through the Convent; which done, ſhe ordered her to bring down her Lute, and leave her to her ſelf in the Garden.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:135663:174"/>All this <hi>Hippolito</hi> ſaw and heard to his inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible Content, yet had he much to do to ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Joy, and hinder it from taking a Vent, which would have ruined the only Opportunity of his Life. <hi>Leonora</hi> withdrew into an Arbour ſo near him, that he could diſtinctly hear her if ſhe Played or Sung: Having tuned her Lute, with a Voice ſoft as the Breath of Angels, ſhe ſung to it this following Air: </p>

He could not help Flattering himſelf, (though at the ſame Time he checked his own Vanity) that he was the Perſon meant in the Song. While he was indulging which thought, to his happy Aſtoniſhment, he heard it encouraged by theſe Words:</p>

I burn and am conſumed with hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Love; thoſe Beams, in whoſe ſoft tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Warmth I wanton'd heretofore, now flaſh Deſtruction to my Soul; my treacherous greedy Eyes have ſuck'd the glaring Light, they have uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all its Rays, and, like a Burning-glaſs, convey'd the pointed Meteor to my Heart— Ah! <hi>Aurelian</hi> how quickly haſt thou conquer'd, and how quickly muſt thou forſake.— Oh happy (to me unfortunately Happy) <hi>Juliana!</hi> —I am to be the Subject of thy Triumph— To thee

                     <hi>Hippolito</hi> could hear no more, he had not room for half his Tranſport. When
<hi>Leonora</hi> perceiv'd a Man coming toward her, ſhe fell a trembling, and could not ſpeak.
<hi>Hippolito</hi> approach'd with Reverence, as to a Sacred Shrine; when coming near enough to ſee her Conſternation, he fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Knees.</p>

He begg'd Pardon for his Treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery in over-hearing, and confeſſed it to be a Crime he had now repeated. With a thouſand Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Entreaties, Prayers, Praiſes, Bleſſings, and paſſionate Expreſſions, he wrought upon her to ſtay and hear him. Here <hi>Hippolito</hi> made uſe of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:135663:176"/> his Rhetorick, and it proved prevailing. 'Twere tedious to tell the many ingenious Arguments he uſed, with all her Nice Diſtinctions and Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In ſhort, he convinced her of his Paſſion, repreſented to her the neceſſity they were under, of being ſpeedy in their Reſolves: That his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (for ſtill he was <hi>Aurelian</hi>) would undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly find him in the Morning, and then it would be too late to repent. She, on the other Hand, knew it was in vain to deny a Paſſion, which he had heard her ſo frankly own; (and no doubt was very glad 'twas paſt and done;) beſides ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the Danger of Delay, and having ſome little Jealouſies and Fears of what Effect might be produced between the Commands of the Father, and the Beauties of <hi>Juliana;</hi> after ſome decent Denials, ſhe conſented to be conducted by him through the Garden into the Convent, where ſhe would prevail with her Confeſſor to Marry them. He was a ſcrupulous Old Father whom they had to deal withall, inſomuch that ere they had perſwaded him, <hi>Don Mario</hi> was returned by the way of his own Houſe, where miſſing his Daughter, and her Woman not being able to give any farther Account of her, than that ſhe left her in the Garden, he concluded ſhe was gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to her Devotions; and indeed he found her in the Chappel upon her Knees with <hi>Hippolito</hi> in her Hand, receiving the Father's Benediction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Concluſion of the Ceremony.</p>
                  <p>It would have ask'd a very skilful Hand, to have depicted to the Life, the Faces of theſe Three Perſons, at <hi>Don Mario</hi>'s Appearance. He that has ſeen ſome admirable Piece of Tranſmutation by a Gorgon's Head, may form to himſelf the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:135663:176"/> moſt probable Idea of the Prototype. The Old Gentleman was himſelf in a ſort of a Wood, to find his Daughter with a Young Fellow and a Prieſt, but as yet he did not know the worſt, till <hi>Hippolito</hi> and <hi>Leonora</hi> came, and kneeling at his Feet, begg'd his Forgiveneſs and Bleſſing as his Son and Daughter. <hi>Don Mario,</hi> inſtead of that, fell into a moſt violent Paſſion, and would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly have committed ſome extravagant Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had he not been reſtrained, more by the Sanctity of the Place, than the Perſwaſions of all the Religious, who were now come about him. <hi>Leonora</hi> ſtirr'd not off her Knees all this time, but continu'd begging of him that he would hear her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="inline">Ah! Ungrateful and Undutiful Wretch, (cry'd he) how haſt thou requited all my Care and Tenderneſs of thee? Now when I might have expected ſome return of Comfort, to throw thy ſelf away upon an unknown Perſon, and, for ought I know, a Villain; to me I'm ſure he is a Villain, who has robb'd me of my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, my Darling Joy, and all the Future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of my Life prevented. Go— go, thou now-to-be-forgotten <hi>Leonora,</hi> go and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy thy unproſperous Choice; you who want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not a Father's Counſel, cannot need, or elſe will ſlight his Bleſſing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe laſt Words were ſpoken with ſo much Paſſion and fatal Concern, that
<hi>Leonora,</hi> moved with Exceſs of Grief, fainted at his Feet, juſt as ſhe had caught hold to embrace his Knees. The Old Man would have ſhook her off, but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and Fatherly Affection came upon him in the midſt of his Reſolve, and melted him into
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:135663:177"/> Tears; he Embraced his Daughter in his Arms, and wept over her, while they endeavoured to reſtore her Senſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hippolito</hi> was in ſuch Concern he could not ſpeak, but was buſily employed in rubbing and chafing her Temples; when ſhe opening her Eyes laid hold of his Arm, and cry'd out— <hi>Oh my</hi> Aurelian— <hi>how unhappy have you made me!</hi> With that ſhe had again like to have faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, but he ſhook her in his Arms, and begg'd <hi>Don Mario</hi> to have ſome pity on his Daughter, ſince by his Severity ſhe was reduced to that Condition. The Old Man hearing his Daughter name <hi>Aurelian,</hi> was a little revived, and began to hope Things were in a pretty good Condition, he was perſwaded to comfort her; and having brought her wholly to her ſelf, was content to hear her Excuſe, and in a little time was ſo far wrought upon as to beg <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Pardon for the Ill Opinion he had conceived of him, and not long after gave his Conſent.</p>
                  <p>The Night was ſpent this Conflict, and it was now clear Day, when <hi>Don Mario</hi> Conducting his new Son and Daughter through the Garden, was met by ſome Servants of the Marqueſs of <hi>Viterbo,</hi> who had been enquiring for <hi>Donna Leonora,</hi> to know if
<hi>Juliana</hi> had lately been with her; for that ſhe was miſſing from her Father's Houſe, and no conjectures could be made of what might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of her. <hi>Don Mario</hi> and
<hi>Leonora</hi> were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at the News, for he knew well enough of the Match that was deſign'd for <hi>Juliana;</hi> and having enquired where the Marqueſs was, it was told him, That he was gone with <hi>Don Fabio</hi> and <hi>Fabritio</hi> toward <hi>Aurelian</hi>'s Lodgings.
<hi>Don Mario</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:135663:177"/> having aſſured the Servants that <hi>Juliana</hi> had not been there, diſmiſſed them, and adviſed with his Son and Daughter how they ſhould undeceive the Marqueſs and <hi>Don Fabio</hi> in their Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Aurelian. Hippolito</hi> could oftentimes ſcarce forbear ſmiling at the old Man's Contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces who was moſt deceived himſelf; he at length adviſed them to go all down together to his Lodging, where he would preſent himſelf before his Father, and ingeniouſly confeſs to him the truth, and he did not queſtion his approving of his Choice.</p>
                  <p>This was agreed to, and the Coach made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. While they were upon their way,
<hi>Hippolito</hi> pray'd heartily that his Friend <hi>Aurelian</hi> might be at the Lodging, to ſatisfie <hi>Don Mario</hi> and <hi>Leonora</hi> of his Circumſtances and Quality, when he ſhould be obliged to diſcover himſelf. His Petitions were granted; for <hi>Don Fabio</hi> had beſet the Houſe long before his Son was up or <hi>Incognita</hi> awake.</p>
                  <p>Upon the arrival of <hi>Don Mario</hi> and <hi>Hippolito,</hi> they heard a great Noiſe and Hubbub above Stairs, which <hi>Don Mario</hi> concluded was occaſioned by their not finding
<hi>Aurelian,</hi> whom he thought he could give the beſt account of: So that it was not in
<hi>Hippolito</hi>'s power to diſſwade him from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up before to prepare his Father to receive and forgive him. While <hi>Hippolito</hi> and <hi>Leonora</hi> were left in the Coach at the Door, he made himſelf known to her, and begg'd her pardon a thouſand times for continuing the deceit. She was under ſome concern at firſt to find ſhe was ſtill miſtaken; but his Behaviour, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he gave, ſoon reconciled him to her; his Perſon was altogether as agreeable, his Eſtate and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:135663:178"/> Quality not at all inferiour to <hi>Aurelian</hi>'s; in the mean time, the true <hi>Aurelian</hi> who had ſeen his Father, begg'd leave of him to withdraw for a moment; in which time he went into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber where his <hi>Incognita</hi> was dreſſing her ſelf, by his deſign, in a Woman's Apparel, while he was conſulting with her how they ſhould break the matter to his Father; it happened that <hi>Don Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi> came up Stairs where the Marqueſs and
<hi>Don Fabio</hi> were; they undoubtedly concluded him Mad, to hear him making Apologies and Excuſes for <hi>Aurelian,</hi> whom he told them if they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to forgive he would preſent before them immediately. The Marqueſs asked him if his Daughter had lain with
<hi>Leonora</hi> that Night; he anſwered him with another queſtion in behalf of
<hi>Aurelian.</hi> In ſhort, they could not underſtand one another, but each thought 'tother beſide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Don Mario</hi> was ſo concern'd that they would not believe him, that he ran down Stairs and came to the Door out of Breath, deſiring <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi> that he would come into the Houſe quickly, for that he could not perſwade his Father but that he had already ſeen and ſpoke to him. <hi>Hippolito</hi> by that underſtood that <hi>Aurelian</hi> was in the Houſe; ſo taking <hi>Leonora</hi> by the Hand, he followed <hi>Don Mario,</hi> who led him up into the Dining-Room, where they found <hi>Aurelian</hi> upon his Knees, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his Father to forgive him, that he could not agree to the Choice he had made for him, ſince he had already diſpoſed of himſelf, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he underſtood the deſigns he had for him, which was the reaſon that he had hitherto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed himſelf. <hi>Don Fabio</hi> knew not how to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him, but look'd upon the Marqueſs, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:135663:178"/> the Marqueſs upon him, as if the Cement had been cool'd which was to have united their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</p>
                  <p>All was ſilent, and <hi>Don Mario</hi> for his part took it to be all Conjuration; he was coming for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to preſent <hi>Hippolito</hi> to them, when <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> ſpying his Friend, ſtarted from his Knees and ran to embrace him— My dear <hi>Hippolito</hi> (ſaid he) what happpy chance has brought you hither, juſt at my Neceſſity? <hi>Hippolito</hi> pointed to <hi>Don Mario</hi> and <hi>Leonora,</hi> and told him upon what terms he came. <hi>Don Mario</hi> was ready to run mad, hearing him called <hi>Hippolito,</hi> and went again to examine his Daughter. While ſhe was informing him of the truth, the Marqueſs's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants returned with the melancholy News that his Daughter was no where to be found. While the Marqueſs and <hi>Don Fabritio</hi> were wondering at, and lamenting the Misfortune of her loſs, <hi>Hippolito</hi> came towards <hi>Don Fabio</hi> and interceded for his Son, ſince the Lady perhaps had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn her ſelf out of an Averſion to the Match. <hi>Don Fabio,</hi> though very much incens'd, yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got not the Reſpect due to <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Quality; and by his Perſwaſion ſpoke to
<hi>Aurelian,</hi> though with a ſtern Look and angry Voice, and asked him where he had diſpoſed the cauſe of his Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, if he were worthy to ſee her or no;
<hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi> made anſwer, That he deſired no more than for him to ſee her; and he did not doubt a Conſequence of his Approbation and Forgiveneſs. — Well (ſaid <hi>Don Fabio</hi>) you are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of your own Diſcretion, let us ſee this Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rety. While
<hi>Aurelian</hi> was gone in for <hi>Incognita,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Viterbo</hi> and
<hi>Don Fabritio</hi> were
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:135663:179"/> taking their leaves in great diſorder for their loſs and diſappointment; but <hi>Don Fabio</hi> entreated their ſtay a moment longer till the return of his Son. <hi>Aurelian</hi> led <hi>Incognita</hi> into the Room veil'd, who ſeeing ſome Company there which he had not told her of, would have gone back again. But <hi>Don Fabio</hi> came bluntly forwards, and ere ſhe was aware, lifted up her Veil, and beheld the Fair <hi>Incognita,</hi> differing nothing from <hi>Juliana,</hi> but in her Name. This diſcovery was ſo extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurprizing and welcome, that either Joy or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement had tied up the Tongues of the whole Company. <hi>Aurelian</hi> here was moſt at a loſs, for he knew not of his Happineſs; and that which all along prevented <hi>Juliana</hi>'s confeſſing her ſelf to him, was her knowing
<hi>Hippolito</hi> (for whom ſhe took him) to be <hi>Aurelian</hi>'s Friend, and ſhe feared if he had known her, that he would never have conſented to have deprived him of her.
<hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liana</hi> was the firſt that ſpoke, falling upon her Knees to her Father, who was not enough him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to take her up. <hi>Don Fabio</hi> ran to her, and awakend the Marqueſs, who then embraced her, but could not yet ſpeak. <hi>Fabritio</hi> and <hi>Leonora</hi> ſtrove who ſhould firſt take her in their Arms; for <hi>Aurelian</hi> he was out of his wits for Joy, and
<hi>Juliana</hi> was not much behind him, to ſee how happily their Loves and Duties were reconciled. <hi>Don Fabio</hi> embraced his Son and forgave him. The Marqueſs and
<hi>Fabritio</hi> gave <hi>Juliana</hi> into his hands, he received the Bleſſing upon his Knees; all were overjoy'd, and <hi>Don Mario</hi> not a little proud at the diſcovery of his Son-in-Law, whom <hi>Aurelian</hi> did not fail to ſet forth with all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Zeal and Eloquence of Friendſhip. <hi>Juliana</hi>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:135663:179"/> and <hi>Leonora</hi> had pleaſant Diſcourſe about their unknown and miſtaken Rivalſhip, and it was the Subject of a great deal of Mirth to hear <hi>Juliana</hi> relate the ſeveral Contrivances which ſhe had to avoid <hi>Aurelian</hi> for the ſake of
<hi>Hippolito.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having diverted themſelves with many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon the pleaſing ſurprize, they all thought it proper to attend upon the Great Duke that Morning at the Palace, and to acquaint him with the Novelty of what had paſs'd; while, by the way, the two Young Couple entertained the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with the Relation of ſeveral Particulars of their Three Days Adventures.</p>

                  <head>THE PILGRIM. A NOVEL.</head>
                  <p>SINCE that the Spirit of Devotion has ſeiſed on the Knights-Errants of this Age, there is ſcarce any thing elſe ſeen in the World. Of truth their Equipage is ſomewhat different from that which their Predeceſſors for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had; for in lieu of a Lance and a Helmet, which they did wear in thoſe days, now they have a Palmers Staff, a Hat trim'd with Cockel-ſhells, and I know not what kind of Rocket, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Back and Breaſt, which indeed are not Iron and Lead proof; but then they do not fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate ſo much their Bearer, as thoſe enchanted Armours formerly did. That which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of their ancient Cuſtom, which devotion it ſelf could not perſwade them to alter, is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Miſs, which ſtill ſticks cloſe to them, and for whoſe ſake, ſometime the <hi>Palmer's</hi> ſtaff does wagg, as the Lance did formerly. In ſhort, what difference ſoever there is betwixt that kind of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:135663:182"/> Life, which they lead now adays in their Foot Travels, and that formerly when they were con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinually beſtriding their Palfreys, all things well conſider'd, it may be ſaid that each condition hath its agreements and its Troubles, its ſweets as well as its labours. For when all is ſaid, it was no ſmall Toil to have ſo many Lances to break, and ſo many Enchantments to put to an end. You doubtleſs may have read, how that when they were to paſs over a Bridge, or to get into a Caſtle, there ſtill was ſome <hi>Giant</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Combat, or ſome Monſter to overcome; but in theſe times, as things are now ordered, all this is done with a Song.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>No Maid, though near ſo ſtout, theſe latter years,</l>
                     <l>But becomes tame, when <hi>Palmer</hi>-ſtaff appears:</l>
                     <l>Nor Buxom Hoſteſs, but will wiſh and long,</l>
                     <l>When once ſhe hears a jolly <hi>Pilgrim</hi>'s Song.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Adventure for Adventure, it is certain that theſe new Knights condition is well worth that of the Knights in former times. At leaſt wiſe, it was made Choice of, by a Perſon of a very good guſto, whom the leanneſs of the Purſe, or the exceſs of Devotion did not oblige to ramble up and down the World under that Figure. This poor <hi>Pilgrim</hi> had but fifty or ſixty thouſand Livers yearly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venew; but here is the real cauſe of his Vocation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rome,</hi> formerly ſo renowed, has not degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of late ſo much in perſons of Wit, as in many other reſpects. It cannot be denied, but that the ways they now have taken unto, tend ſomewhat more towards evil than formerly, and though it ſtill is the place in which the ſanctity of the earth does reſide, it is no leſs a ſource of debauchery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:135663:182"/>There has always been found in it divers Acca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies of great Wits, but in our time none has made ſo much noiſe as that which was call'd of the Libertines; not only by reaſon of thoſe bold diſcourſes which were held in it; but for thoſe terrible
<hi>Satyrs</hi> which it ſent forth againſt all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons without exception. The Holy Father, to whoſe feet the firſt complaints againſt it were humbly laid down, by thoſe perſons that were concern'd in thoſe Truths which thoſe Accademicks did publiſh, was obliged to ſend forth divers Thundering Excommunications againſt this Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. But they being but little daunted at the <hi>Vaticans</hi> Arms, did but laugh and ſcoff at the Pope's juſt indignation; bringing him, and the Cardinals alſo, into play, which is the only Crime, that is not to be forgiven in <hi>Rome.</hi> Therefore it was no longer Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> that armed himſelf with Thunderbolts for their deſtruction, but Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who with the Sword in hand, made a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit after thoſe impious perſons. There never was ſeen ſo many ſorts of perſons combined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as there was then, to deſtroy thoſe Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines: Serjeants, Watch-men, Guards, Souldiers, <hi>Monks,</hi> Prelates, both on foot and on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, all were under Arms, and one would real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have taken it for a Cruſado.</p>
                  <p>There were but few perſons in <hi>Rome</hi> that had not ſome ſhare in their
<hi>Satyrs,</hi> and half the City was already providing Faggots for them, ſo that it was high time to ſound the Retreat: Every one got away as well as he could, ſome diſguis'd after one manner, and ſome after another. Our <hi>Hero,</hi> who was one of the moſt eminent amongſt them, hid himſelf under the Habit of a <hi>Pilgrim;</hi> with
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:135663:183"/> which, having got, without any Retinue, to <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vita Vecchia,</hi> he took a <hi>Felouqua,</hi> that carried him to <hi>Genoua.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His deſign was for <hi>France;</hi> but the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a Gally, which was going to put off for <hi>Barcelona,</hi> where it was carrying a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lord, General Maſter
<hi>de</hi> Camp, of the <hi>Cavalry</hi> of the State of <hi>Millan,</hi> having made him change his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, he embarqued to make the ſame Voyage upon it.</p>
                  <p>There was a great number of Paſſengers on that Gally; and our <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> who, beſides the trouble of the Crowd, was not willing to be known, being yet ſo near
<hi>Italy,</hi> did accoſt the Captain, and with a Complement of few words, he ſlid into his hand a Role of Piſtols, to make him underſtand by his Liberality, and his good Mien, that he was no common <hi>Pilgrim.</hi> The Captain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore treated him according as his Complement and his good Mien did deſerve: for he gave him his own Cabin, which was joyning to that of the Spaniſh <hi>Don,</hi> and caus'd him to be ſerv'd by two Slaves during the whole Voyage.</p>
                  <p>The Wind was as favourable as could be, and they had not ſo ſoon hoiſed Sails, but they loſt the ſight of <hi>Genoua.</hi> Prudence would not yet allow our <hi>Pilgrim</hi> to be much ſeen, though they were already well off at Sea. He therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd not to ſtir forth out of his Chamber, till he were arrived at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and to divert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the mean time in reading of Books. This was an agreeable employment to him, but it laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not long; for the very next day, his reading was interrupted by the charming Voice of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that was in the General's Chamber. He lent
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:135663:183"/> an Ear, and underſtood that ſhe ſung ſome <hi>Italian</hi> Aires. His Curioſity did each moment encreaſe, and being Charm'd with the ſweetneſs of the Voice, he would willingly have ſeen that Perſon. He viſited and ſearch'd the Partition of the Cabin from one end to the other, to find out ſome Chink, but the Boards were ſo well joynted, that it was labour in vain. In fine, at night when the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, who us'd to eat with him, was come to ſee him, and to ſup; he ſet him on a Diſcourſe concerning the Spaniſh <hi>Don,</hi> and having particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly made inquiry concerning his Retinue and Family, he learn'd that it was the Marqueſs of <hi>L.</hi> lately married at <hi>Milan,</hi> where he had eſpouſed the Daughter of the Count <hi>N.</hi> one of the moſt charming Perſons in all <hi>Italy,</hi> of whom he was ſo jealous, that there was but two old Women that ſerv'd her, that had the liberty of entring her Chamber; neither would he have her to be ſeen by any of his own ſervants. <hi>Camille,</hi> ſo was the <hi>Pilgrim</hi> nam'd, did on a ſuddain fall into a profound ſilence, ſeriouſly reflecting on what the Captain did tell him, not doubting but that the Voice that had charm'd him did belong to the beautiful Marchioneſs. This made him more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt than ever to ſee her, and he was already al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt fallen in Love; he did eat little or nothing, during that meal, and dying with impatiency to have the Captain gone, that he might, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, make a new ſearch after ſome means to pry into that Chamber. The very Idea which he did frame to himſelf of that beautiful Lady, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Captain's words, did inflame him with love, and the Jealouſie of the Husband, which did detain her in that Captivity, did already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:135663:184"/> him with ſuch deſigns, as did flatter him with ſome hopes of a good fortune. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain being at laſt gone, he ſhuts the Cabin door, and with the Candle in his hand, ſearches and examines every board one after another, above, beneath, on the right, on the left, all over, but no hopes. He Torments himſelf, ſweats, ſighs, and almoſt in deſpair, he would endeavour to make ſome hole, with an Iron he had found, when fortune guided his eyes upon a knot in a board, which did anſwer juſt upon the Ladies Bed, and that could be got out without much difficulty. Never was joy comparable to his, he preſently peeps through the hole, and ſees the moſt beautiful woman that ever was in the World, in a moſt manificent Undreſs, who was at her Toylet undreſſing her ſelf for bed. He could not ſee her but of one ſide, and the hole being but ſmall, he could but imperfectly diſcern ſuch Features, as were of power to have inchanted a Man much leſs prepoſſeſt than he was; but he did ſee enough to accompliſh his bondage, and yet think himſelf the happieſt Man in all the World. Nothing on earth could have drawn him from thence; and he us'd no other Caution than the putting out of his Candle, for fear of being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and was preparing himſelf for a moſt charming pleaſure at her going in bed, when fickle Fortune, who had been ſo favourable to him, did preſently fill his heart with darkneſs; for the Marqueſs being entred the Chamber to go to bed, went and hung his Cloak (an Ornament which the Spaniſh Gravity will not allow to be quitted but rarely) upon that very place, where was the little peephole; a moſt ſorrowful Vail unto the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:135663:184"/> Amorous <hi>Camille,</hi> which caus'd a ſad Eclipſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his heart, and that moſt charming object. His ſorrow is eaſie to be imagin'd, yet he left not his poſt, but making uſe of his Ears, where his Eyes could not reach, he heard certain diſcourſes, which did not pleaſe him leſs than what he had ſeen: They were little Jars between the Husband and the Wife, which did ſpeak the ill underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there was between them; The Ladies complaints againſt the rigorous proceedings of her Lord; and his reproaches on her Humour of Courtſhip. Our <hi>Pilgrim</hi> building on this bottom greater and fairer hopes than ever, he did paſs the beſt part of the night, in framing to himſelf ſuch Ideas, as afforded him as much content as would to others, every charming reality: at laſt he muſt go to bed, for there had not been any noiſe heard in the Chamber of two hours; but how can a perſon ſleep, that has his mind fill'd with what he had beheld that day? and what he did hope to ſee the next morning, if fortune would have it, that the Jealous Husband ſhould riſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lady, and take the envious Cloak along with him? that which troubled him moſt, was the wind, which ſtill continuing favourable would not let him long enjoy this Happineſs: For it was probable that with ſuch a wind they would arrive the next day at <hi>Barcelona;</hi> which would put an end to his adventure, except love, who is pleas'd with extraordinary things, ſhould favour him with ſome turn of fortune, of which he durſt not much flatter himſelf. The beſt part of the night he ſpent in thoughts, and yet in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion paſſed it well, though he had had no ſleep. So ſoon as he did ſee day appear, he aroſe, but it
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:135663:185"/> was ſomewhat too early yet for perſons that had no ſuch diſquiet as he had in his mind. He fitted the knot to its hole, and had the patience to wait a great while, inceſſantly hearkning with a ſtrange anguiſh of mind, whether the Marqueſs was not ſtirring, which unfortunately to him did not riſe ſo ſoon that day, as he us'd to do; and when up, he walked in his Chamber till he was adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd that they were in ſight of
<hi>Palamos.</hi> Then out he went in his Spaniſh <hi>Decorum</hi> to behold that City. His Lady who was yet in bed, and who had the ſame Curioſity, got out of it in a pretty kind of diſorder, to run to the Window. Then it was that our good <hi>Pilgrim</hi> had that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſight which he had ſo much deſired, for in that haſte in which the Lady had riſen, ſhe ſhew'd him ſuch things as were able to inchant the Gods. He was not contented with this, but tranſported with ardor and love, he alſo went to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber window, which was very near unto that in which the Marchioneſs was; and but half ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, leſt any one ſhould ſee him, he made her a Reverence much more amorous than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, looking on her with eyes that did ſpeak ſome part of thoſe things which he felt in his Soul. The beautiful Marchioneſs (who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the genius of the Italian Ladies, was very expert in that Language) was at firſt ſurpriz'd to ſee ſo near her a Man with ſo good a meen; but after ſhe had look'd about, to ſee if any body did obſerve her, ſhe did very obligingly anſwer his Salute. Our amorous <hi>Pilgrim</hi> would gladly have had this Language of the Eyes changed into an entertainment of the mouth, but it was too much to be fear'd, that they would have been heard.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:135663:185"/> And the Lady who did fear to be ſurpriz'd by her Guardians, or Husband, durſt not make any longer ſtay at the Window. <hi>Camille,</hi> who did follow her every where with his Eyes and Heart, did retire preſently alſo to his former Port, where he did behold the Marchioneſs, who was got to bed again, who not imagining, to be obſerved, lay in ſuch a poſture, by reaſon of the great heat of the Seaſon, as was capable to kill a man with Love. Neck, Breaſt, Arms, Feet, Legs; in fine, all the moſt Beatiful and Charming things in the World, were expos'd at the mercy of our <hi>Pilgrim</hi>'s Eyes, who at this ſight did quickly loſe the reſt of his liberty.</p>
                  <p>Preſently after, her Women came in to dreſs her, and <hi>Camille,</hi> who had receiv'd as much as he wanted, ritired, for Fear that amongſt ſo many Eyes, there might be ſome that may light acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally upon his Peep-hole, which would ſpoil all. Imagining alſo, that in ſo great a Buſtle of Women he ſhould have but an imperfect View of the Lady.</p>
                  <p>Never any Man ſo pleas'd as he, if his good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had laſted but ſome time longer; but they ſtill approached nearer <hi>Barcellona,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of that moment, which was to part 'em, and that would peradventure make him loſe for ever the ſight of what he ſo paſſionately loved: Good Gods! would he frequently cry out ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſome Blaſts of a contrary Wind! His Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were not heard; Time preſt upon them, and finally there muſt be a reſolution taken to ſpeak out ſome way, whereby he might be underſtood; he found ſome Paper, Pen and Ink, and without further Delay, he wrote ſome <hi>Italian</hi> Verſes to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:135663:186"/>
                     <l>When by a too Rigorous Fate,</l>
                     <l>Moſt Beauteous Lady, your curſt Mate</l>
                     <l>Shall force you, through his jealous Rage,</l>
                     <l>To free your ſelf; I dare engage,</l>
                     <l>By a certain Am'rous Art,</l>
                     <l>When juſt y're ready to depart,</l>
                     <l>To have a <hi>Pilgrim</hi> wait at hand,</l>
                     <l>In Obedience t' your Command.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Having finiſh'd his Verſes, he waited till he ſaw no body in the Ladies Chamber, and having rolled up the Paper, he put it through the hole, which heing juſt in the Ladies ſight, could not fail of drawing her Eyes upon it. She was at firſt ſurpriz'd at the Novelty thereof, which caus'd her to bluſh extremely, not doubting but it was expoſed there by that Cavalier which ſhe had ſeen at the Window, and whoſe good Mien had raiſed in her a great Curioſity to know what he was: But when ſhe reflected on thoſe advantages, which he might have made uſe of by means of that hole, during the freedom which ſhe had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken all the time ſhe had been in that Cabin, it wanted but little, that an Anger mixt with Baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, did not produce ſome kind of Hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Man, of whom ſhe had ſo little Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. She was ſtrangely buſied in her Thoughts, and knew not what to reſolve; mean time the Paper which ſhe ſaw to wag continually, giving her an extream deſire to ſee what it might be, and fearing on the other hand that ſomebody would come into the Cabin, her Anger and Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were forc'd to give place her Curioſity; ſhe approached, took the Note, looked through the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:135663:186"/> hole, and did ſee a Pilgrim, whoſe good Mien did ſomewhat appeaſe her; ſhe preſently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, and having ſeated her ſelf again upon her Bed, ſhe unfolded the Paper with a Mind ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken up with this Adventure. In ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as ſhe was at that time, evil-intreated by an Husband, which ſhe had never lov'd, and who prepared himſelf to make her ſuffer new Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in a Countrey, where Women are yet greater Slaves than in that, from whence ſhe came, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be offered, that could bring her more Content, than that which the <hi>Pilgrim</hi> did write. Till then ſhe had not been a moment without wiſhing, that the Veſſel might ſplit upon the Coaſt, or that it might fall into the Hands of the <hi>Turk,</hi> rather than arrive in <hi>Spain;</hi> and never ceaſed her Tears, ſince ſhe had ſeen Land. And yet when the Heavens grant her her deſires in a more favourable manner than ſhe had required, and when ſhe deſpair'd of making Ship-wrack, or falling into the Pirats Hands, being almoſt at the Gates of <hi>Barcellona,</hi> ſhe tremblingly looks upon the Succour which is offer'd her, ſhe ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in her Reſolution, ſhe loſes her Courage, and fears to employ a Man, that hath nothing in his Perſon, but what aſſures, and gives her to underſtand, that he is a gallant Perſon. Of truth ſhe was not long in thoſe Irreſolutions, having caſt her ſight upon <hi>Spain,</hi> and made ſome refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions upon the unhappy Life which ſhe was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to lead there, ſhe preſently reſolv'd to give her ſelf up to the Conduct of a Perſon, that ſeemed to be ſent to her by Heaven for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. She would willingly have ſignify'd ſo much to him; but it was long ſince all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:135663:187"/> to writing was forbid her, and one of her Women being come into her Cabin, neither could ſhe come near unto the little Hole, in which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the generous
<hi>Pilgrim</hi>'s Eye to glitter; ſhe contented her ſelf in giving him to underſtand, with ſuch ſigns as the <hi>Italians</hi> are very expert in, that ſhe did very much like and approve of the Tender of his Services, and that he ſhould not be unhappy, if he could take her out of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable Condition, to which ſhe was reduced. At laſt <hi>Camille,</hi> who ſtood moſt attentively, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining even the very leaſt twinkling of an Eye, did interpret it after this manner; and it may be imagined, that the <hi>Pilgrim</hi>'s apprehenſion might very well reach as far, as the Ladies dumb Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Never was Lover ſo pleas'd with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as he. He would not have chang'd his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune for a Monarch's Diadem, no, not for the Pope's Triple Crown. The leaſt Look, a kind Geſture, or ſome favourable Sign, did afford him more Content, than the whole Empire of the World would give unto the moſt ambitious of Kings.</p>
                  <p>This pretty ſport laſted till they were ready to enter into the Port of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> when the Lady being left a moment alone drew near unto him, and told him, in a low Voice, that ſhe had appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended what he had writ, that ſhe believ'd him a Man of honourable Principles, and even ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than what he appear'd to be under that <hi>Pilgrim</hi>'s Habit; and that if he could deliver her from the Tyranny of a Jealous Husband, and were a perſon that would receive ſome recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for ſo great a ſervice, ſhe did aſſure him, that he ſhould have cauſe to be ſatisfied, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:135663:187"/> perform'd ſo generous an Action. And not giving him time to reply, fearing inceſſantly to be ſurpriz'd, ſhe deſired him to find out ſome means, by which ſhe might write or ſpeak to him, when arriv'd at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and ending with theſe words, ſhe put through the hole one of her Fingers, on which ſhe had a very fair Diamond, with which ſhe would have preſented him; but <hi>Camille</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kiſſed a thouſand times that delicate Finger, did not think of taking the Ring: ſo that ſhe let it fall expreſly. But the
<hi>Pilgrim</hi> was ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with Love and Pleaſure, that he took no notice of it: And the Marqueſs being juſt come in to tell his wife, that it was time to prepare her ſelf to Land, ſhe withdrew, to <hi>Camille's</hi> great ſorrow, who ſome moments after went out of his Chamber, to behold the beautiful Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to be ſeen by her.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> who had not appear'd during all the Voyage, and had embark'd himſelf in the Night time, did ſurprize every body at his appearance upon the Deck; every one gueſſing by his Ayre, his Gate, and thoſe Accoutrements which he had under his <hi>Pilgrim</hi>'s Weeds, that he was nothing leſs than what he appeared to be. The Marqueſs and his Lady, who came forth of their Cabin a moment after, found him upon the Deck leaning on his Staff, holding his Hat with Shells under his Arm, in a certain Poſture as did preſently draw their Eyes upon him, though with diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Thoughts. The Marchioneſs had a Manto upon her Head after the Spaniſh Faſhion, which did cover her whole Face; ſo that <hi>Camille</hi> had but the Pleaſure of admiring her fine Shape, and the charming Aire of her whole Compoſure, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:135663:188"/> that too by ſtealth, for fear of creating new Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in the Husband, who had his Eyes inceſſantly fixed upon him, beholding him, as a Bird of evil Preſage; for he was of Opinion, that the whole World had a Mind to his Wife. At laſt he came near unto him, and made him ſome Queſtions, to find if he were not deceived in his Diſtruſt. As they were diſcourſing together, and that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Don's fears did ſtill increaſe more and more, to hear a <hi>Pilgrim</hi> reaſon with ſo much wit as this did appear to have; the Captain of the Veſſel came up to <hi>Camille,</hi> and with a Reverence that did out-paſs what was due to an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> he asked him if he had not loſt a Ring, ſhewing him at the ſame time, that which the Marchioneſs had let fall from her finger, and told him that he had juſt then found it in his Chamber; <hi>Camille,</hi> who had not the leaſt thought of the favour, which the Marchioneſs had intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, anſwer'd him no, and that it did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto him; but the Marqueſs having preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known it, did moſt terribly bluſh, and God knows with what fury his Soul was inſtantly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd! yet he diſſembled all, and choſe rather to loſe the Ring, than to divulge his ſhame, in own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be his Wives. He left the unfortunate <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> for preſently his firſt ſuſpitions had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len on him again, and retiring into his Chamber, cauſed the Marchioneſs to be call'd, with ſuch a cold Air, as did diſguiſe the rage and violence of divers paſſions, which then poſſeſſed him; he inquired of her, what ſhe had done with her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amond. The poor diſtreſſed Lady, more pale than Death, fearing that ſhe had been betray'd by the
<hi>Pilgrim,</hi> anſwer'd him in a ſtammering
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:135663:188"/> voice, that ſhe believ'd ſhe had loſt it. Then did the Jealous Husband, giving a full vent unto his fury, let himſelf be carried away to ſuch violent actions as were very unworthy a perſon of his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. <hi>Camille</hi> who knew not the reaſon, why the Marqueſs and his Lady were retired, ſtrangely ſurpriz'd at the noiſe he heard, run to his Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin to learn what might be the occaſion; there he beheld the lovely Marchioneſs leaning upon her bed, and her unworthy Husband, in a great fury, walking in the Room, and giving her all manner of ill Language. Nothing could more grieve his Soul, than that ſad Spectacle: he was a thouſand times in a reſolution to go in to them, to revenge ſuch Tears as did rend his heart in pieces, the which to prevent he would have given his life. Nothing but the conſideration of the loſs of the Marchioneſs, which he foreſaw would be infallible, if he ſhould proceed ſo far in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments, did prevent him. He would gladly have known the cauſe of this Quarrel, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that he had given any ſuch occaſion to the Marqueſs, who being ſomewhat more cool, was going to inform him of all things, by thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches that he had begun to make to his Wife; when he had notice given him, that the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> who was his near Kinſman, was coming in perſon to receive him, and that his Skiff was already got near to the Veſſel; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, laying aſide the reſt of his anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome other time, he left his Wife in the Cabbin, that ſhe might have ſome time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect her ſelf, and went forth to meet the Governour. The deſolate Marchioneſs in this Affliction, greater than can be expreſs'd, for
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:135663:189"/> having been thus villanouſly betray'd by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for whom ſhe had at firſt ſight conceived a great eſteem, was framing within her ſelf moſt ſtrong reſolutions, never more to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide ſo lightly in perſons that ſhe did not know, and as ſhe was going forth ſhe eſpy'd the <hi>Pilgrim</hi> looking through the hole. Ah! Traytor, ſaid ſhe to him, did I preſent you with that Diamond, but to ruine me by it? Go, I ſhall be revenged if I can; and without ſtaying for an anſwer, ſhe followed her Husband.
<hi>Camille,</hi> who was afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even to death, to be call'd Traytor, by that perſon that he would have leaſt betray'd of all the world, was a while like a man poſſeſt with ſorrow, deſpair and amazement. Traytor! Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor! did he repeat twice or thrice over, what Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can I have committed againſt her? I that have not known her but one day, and that would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice a thouſand lives to do her ſervice. With this he let himſelf drop upon a Bench, and reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on that which the Marchioneſs had reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him concerning a Diamond, and then on the Ring which the Captain would have given him before the Marqueſs, believing that it was his; it came in his mind, that he had ſeen ſuch a one on the Marchioneſs finger, and thus little by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle unravelling this cruel Myſtery, he eaſily did perceive that he was the only cauſe of all that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. In what deſpair did he fall on the ſudden? but not to loſe time in ſuperfluous exclamations, he went to the Captain, and did engage him to return him that Ring; then preſently running to the other end of the Ship, he found that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour was newly arriv'd, and that he was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing with the Marqueſs. He takes the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:135663:189"/> of thoſe Ceremonies, to reſtore to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs her Ring, but as he approaches her, ſhe flys, and thus they both went round the Deck. <hi>Camille,</hi> who perceived this her diſdain, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at laſt to ſhew her the Diamond, to let her know it was to reſtore it, that he would approach her. But the Marchioneſs did underſtand it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, and believing that this <hi>Pilgrim</hi> was of intelligence with her Husband, who doubtleſs had given him that Ring as a reward of his Treachery, ſhe imagain'd that he ſought how to bring her into further trouble: She was alſo cruelly vexed that he had the confidence to ſhew it her, as glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in it; and raiſing her Manto a little, ſhe look'd upon him with the eyes of a Woman that was infinitely angry at his inſolency. At which our unhappy Lover apprehending that ſhe would not receive it, ſtood ſtill looking upon her, with a ſad and afflicted Countenance, which was the only thing capable of juſtifying him at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. But when the heart is prepoſſeſſed with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, the impreſſion of it is not ſo ſoon wiped off. The Marchioneſs could not ſee any thing in this buſineſs, but what did accuſe the
<hi>Pilgrim</hi> of a moſt palpable Treaſon, or at leaſt of an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, of which a perſon, as he ſeemed to be in her eyes, was not capable of: yet ſhe could not but feel ſomething within her ſelf, which ſeemed to ſpeak him leſs guilty than he appear'd; and yet knew not why, and ſhe was troubled, that ſo accompliſh'd a perſon, and who did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to her ſo worthy, could ſubmit to do ſo baſe an action.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Civilities at laſt being ended, which on ſuch occaſions are commonly ſomewhat long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:135663:190"/> the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the Marqueſs and his Lady enter'd into the Governour's Boat to go to Shore. And <hi>Camille</hi> in that of the Captains, which he gave him, and which he made to follow cloſe that of the Governour's. They arrived almoſt at the ſame time upon the Mole, where they met with the Governour's Lady, accompanied with divers Ladies and Gentlemen of the Country, who waited for the Marchioneſs to Complement her: <hi>Camille</hi> would gladly have found out ſome means to ſpeak a word to her in the Crowd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhould be wholly deprived of the ſight of her; but there was no likelihood of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her in the Dreſs he was in, eſpecially in ſuch a Concourſe. He did ſee her take Coach with the other Ladies, and having follow'd them to the Palace, where the Marqueſs was to reſide with the Governour, he went to ſeek out ſome Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for himſelf.</p>
                  <p>He paſſed the whole Night in Sighs and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grets, the ordinary Comfort of deſolate Lovers, ſeeking within his Mind after ſomething that might make his innocency appear to the Object of his love, and juſtifie himſelf of a Crime which he would not have committed againſt the laſt of Women. He durſt not hope for ſo much Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as to ſpeak to her, imagining that in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſhe had of him, ſhe would not make one ſtep towards it; but he did not believe it wholly impoſſible, that by contriving intreagues upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treagues, he might get a Letter ſafely delivered to her. He knew that in thoſe kind of things, the ſureſt way was to act Perſonally, and not truſt to others. Therefore he try'd whether with a little good management of his own, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:135663:190"/> any other aſſiſtance, he could compaſs this buſineſs. In
<hi>Spain,</hi> as in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Churches are the chiefeſt Places where Lovers repair to ſeek their Miſtreſſes: and thus abuſing of thoſe things, which are moſt holy, they go to commit great Crimes in Places that are appointed where to ask Pardon for committing them.
<hi>Camille,</hi> who was not ignorant of the Spaniſh Bigotry, did imagine that the Marqueſs would not fail to go with his Wife that Morning to hear Maſs, to give God thanks for their happy Voyage, and that it would be a fit Place to deliver her a Note, if Fortune or Love would never ſo little Favour his deſign. This reſolution being taken, he intreated his Hoſt, who was an
<hi>Italian,</hi> to get him conducted by ſome Perſon to the Chappel of the Palace, if there was any, or to that Church, which the Governour was us'd to frequent: he was ſerv'd as he deſired, and brought to the Palace, where he did ſee a moſt ſumptuous Chappel, and in it the Governour's Wife, who was hearing Maſs, and who ſeeing him enter, was much ſurpriz'd with his good Mien, ſuch as was not very ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily found in <hi>Pilgrims:</hi> But the Marqueſs and his Lady had paſſed the Night too ill to riſe ſo early. There had been nothing but reproaches, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, menances, and quarrels between them, which having laſted almoſt till Day, were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed on both ſides with Hatred, and Heart-burnings, which had kept them long from ſleep. The Marqueſs, and reaſon good, would be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd how his Wife had convey'd that Diamond into that Chamber where the Captain had found it, and what ſhe intended by it: Whether it was not for that <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> who ſhe doubtleſs did know,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:135663:191"/> and who did follow her under that diſguiſe. The Lady finding that he was no better informed of the buſineſs, took Courage, ſtood upon her own defence, cry'd out, ſpoke, and threatned, as loud as her Husband. The only regret ſhe had was for having treated ſo ſeverely that <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> whom ſhe believ'd was not ſo guilty as ſhe had thought him, and who had expreſt a deſign to ſerve her in a handſome manner; not that ſhe did wholly excuſe his imprudence in letting that Ring be ſeen by her Husband, but ſhe did believe that there might be ſome ill fortune in it, but no ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; and thereupon did chide her ſelf for having ſo ſoon condemned a Perſon who had ſo generouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offer'd himſelf to free her from that miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition ſhe liv'd in, not thinking ever to find again ſo fair an occaſion; for ſhe hardly had any hopes of ever ſeeing him more, after ſuch a piece of Injuſtice as ſhe had done him.</p>
                  <p>The Night being paſs'd in this manner, they did not riſe, but juſt to ſit at table; where the Governour and his Lady did wait for them to dine: The Company had ſcarce begun to eat, when <hi>Donna Barbara d' Ayamonte,</hi> ſo was named the Governour's Wife, did begin a Diſcourſe of a young Pilgrim which ſhe had ſeen at Maſs, there being no quality in his Perſon that ſhe had not taken ſpecial notice of, and did not praiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly; further ſaying, being of a more free humour than the Cuſtom of the Country did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly allow, that ſhe had very much wiſhed he had approached nearer her, that ſhe might have asked him of what Country he was, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but that there were ſome conſiderable Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in that kind of life, that a Man ſo well made
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:135663:191"/> as he was, did lead about the World, under the Notion of a Pilgrim. The Vice-Roy, who was very gallant, and who having not the Diſeaſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Husbands, had always given a modeſt Liberty unto his Wife, who began not to be altogether ſo young, and had never been over-handſom, did play upon her very much about the Pilgrim, and ſet all the Company in a good Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, except the Marqueſs, who at the very Name of <hi>Pilgrim</hi> had taken upon him a Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Mien; and not doubting but it was the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Blade who had been to ſeek after his Wife in that Chappel. He was almoſt ſtark mad to ſee his Wife well pleas'd with what the Governour did ſay, and he look'd upon her as if he would devour her with his Eyes: The Marchioneſs, who did obſerve all thoſe Grimaces, did not much concern her ſelf with them; on the contrary, ſhe did laugh at 'em more and more, being certain that what <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> ſaid to that Pilgrim's advantage, did give the Marqueſs as much of Trouble, as it afforded her of Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Camille</hi> was at the Chappel the next Morning again, but as unſucceſsful as the firſt time, not finding there what he ſought after. <hi>Donna Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bara,</hi> who had extreamly deſired to ſee him once more, did no ſooner caſt her Eyes upon him, but ſhe ſhew'd him unto the Governour, who had ſo much Complaiſance for his Wife, as to have him call'd ſo ſoon as Maſs was ended. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour made him divers Queſtions, to which he anſwered with ſo good a Grace, and ſo much Wit, that he was much taken with him as well as his Wife. He bid him come and ſee him, and that in the Condition he was, if he wanted
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:135663:192"/> any thing he might have recourſe unto him. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Pilgrim had given him to underſtand he was above Want, he thank'd him for the favour he did him in giving him leave to wait upon him, of which he would make uſe; after this he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd, giving them ſufficiently to underſtand by all that he had ſaid, as well as by his Carriage, and the fine Ayre of his Perſon, that he underſtood Courtſhip, even after the beſt manner. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour was much pleas'd at it, and did no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſee the Marqueſs and his Lady, but he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd his Wives Pilgrim unto them, for ſo he call'd him, and promiſed likewiſe that they ſhould ſee him. The Marqueſs, who had not yet taken any notice that he knew him, did imagine that it would be needleſs to conceal his knowledge of him any longer, and almoſt dead for fear this Traytor ſhould come to the Palace, if he uſed not ſome Stratagem to put it off; he drew aſide the Governour, and told him that he knew not of what Pilgrim he did ſpeak, but that if it was a certain Raſcal who was come in the ſame Veſſel with him from <hi>Genoua,</hi> and conceal'd himſelf all the time that he had been at Sea, he did declare to him, that he was the moſt dangerous and moſt wicked Perſon in all <hi>Italy;</hi> that he had known him upon the Veſſel, and had ſpoken to him; that he was a <hi>Bandite</hi> of <hi>Genoua,</hi> who had been above a Year Priſoner in the Caſtle of <hi>Milan,</hi> whence at laſt he had made his eſcape, after he had been convinc'd of having been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed as a Spye by the Enemies of that State: That doubtleſs he came into <hi>Spain</hi> upon ſome ſuch like deſigns, and that for his part, if he were in a place where he had any Authority, he
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:135663:192"/> would certainly ſecure him, and detain him in a Dungeon, till he had confeſſed what he came for into <hi>Spain</hi> under that diſguiſe, or that at the leaſt he would ſend him back to <hi>Italy.</hi> All this he ſpoke to him as an Advice of great conſequence which he ought not to deſpiſe. The Governour did hearken to him with a great amazement, not being able to quit very eaſily the good Opinion which he had conceived, for the Pilgrim, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to him nothing leſs than what the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs would make him to be.
<hi>Might you not, my Lord,</hi> ſaid he twice unto him, <hi>miſtake your ſelf? And do you knom him well? For he qualifies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a</hi> Roman, <hi>and I can aſſure you that he has not the accent of</hi> Genoua, <hi>and that a Man who had ſo much Wit as this ſeems to have, had not need to take upon him the Employ of a Spy. If he is ſo as you repreſent him,</hi> ſaid the Marqueſs, <hi>it cannot be the ſame Perſon; and I adviſe you once more,</hi> continued he, raiſing of his Voice, <hi>that you take good notice of him; for I know what he hath done in more than one place;</hi> and upon that, to make good what he had ſaid before, he invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two or three ſtories, ſuch as his Jealous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour did ſuggeſt unto him; unto which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour had much to do to give Credit. Mean time, as he could not give a gueſs at the Intereſt which did make the Marqueſs ſpeak this; he did believe it part of the Duty of his Office, not wholly to neglect his advice, and after he had expreſs'd how much he was obliged to him for it, he told him, that he believed that this Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim would come to ſee him that Day, that he would examine him, and then he ſhould know what he had to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:135663:193"/>
                     <hi>Camille</hi> who knew nothing of thoſe good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices which were rendred him at the Palace, was tranſported with joy to have advanced his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo far with the Governour, as to be invited by him to give him a Viſit, which would give him the moſt favourable acceſs in the World at his Palace, whereby he might have the opportunity to ſee, perhaps to ſpeak, or at leaſt to write unto the beauteous Marchioneſs. He already dyes with Impatiency, that the fit hour to render that Viſit in, is not come yet. At laſt he goes to the Palace, where the Governour made him a no leſs gracious reception than he had done in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Chappel. He examines, he queſtions, and entertains him on divers things, and finds not the leaſt ſign in him of what he was accuſed; on the contrary, a great Fond of Honour, the judgment of a Perſon of Quality, and his Converſation ſo charming, that he was amazed how the Marqueſs could entertain ſuch a thought of him, if this was that Perſon which he had ſeen, and had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in diſcourſe on the Ship. Mean time, the Duty of his Charge, requiring that he ſhould proceed further; after he had ſpoken, during ſome time, of things in general, he came to particulars, and ask'd him by way of raillery, if it were a Spirit of Devotion, or ſome ſecret Deſign which he might have in <hi>Spain,</hi> that had made him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to travel thither under that Pilgrims Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit: <hi>Camille</hi> anſwered him ſmileingly, That there was more of a Caprichio than of a Deſign in his diſguiſe; but that knowing the Charity that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had for all thoſe that did vow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to <hi>S. Jaques,</hi> he had taken in hand a Palmers ſtaff to ſerve him as a Paſs. The Governour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:135663:193"/> That he knew well he had no occaſion of any ſuch aid, and then, putting on a more ſerious Countenance, he added, that there had been very ill Reports made of him, which he could not attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute but to his diſguiſe, that therefore he did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe him to take an Apparel more ſuitable to a Perſon of Quality, as he did believe he was, and that if he had no buſineſs in <hi>Barcelona,</hi> that he ſhould quit that City ſo ſoon as he could: That he would allow him three Days to end his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in, during which time he would do well not to let himſelf be ſeen, and leſs about the Palace than in any other Place: That he would have him believe it was with an extreme regret that he acted thus; and that if he could have given credit but to part of thoſe things which had been ſpoken againſt him, he had been obliged to treat him with much more ſeverity than he did: That if he wanted mony, or any thing elſe, to retire himſelf from thence, he ſhould but name it, and he ſhould be furniſhed with all things neceſſary, but that abſolutely he could not diſpenſe from giving him that order.
<hi>Camille,</hi> amaz'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded at once with the Governour's Bounties, and with ſo cruel and unexpected a blow, after he had told the Governour that he was the moſt unhappy of all Men to have given an occaſion for ſuch evil impreſſions, which he could attribute but to his ill Fortune; he did return him thanks for all thoſe Favous which he had received from him, aſſuring him, that ſince he was pleas'd to give him three Days time longer before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from <hi>Barcelona,</hi> he would employ them to ſuch a uſe as ſhould not give to any Perſon the leaſt cauſe of complaint, or of any ſuſpition
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:135663:194"/> as to his conduct; and in this manner he took leave of the Governour.</p>
                  <p>No Man more diſconſolate than <hi>Camille,</hi> to find himſelf on ſuch a ſudden fallen from all thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous hopes which he had too ſoon conceived, and what was worſt of all, to be obliged to quit the City within three Days; a ſhort time for a Lover; at leaſt if he could but once have ſpoken or Writ to the Marchioneſs, and taken her off of thoſe ſo diſadvantagious reſentments which ſhe had for him, and that he might but hope to take his leave of her; but he is baniſhed from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace without daring to approach it: That was too ſevere: a Lover may promiſe ſuch things, but it is to be feared that he will not obſerve them. It is rare to betray ones ſelf; and it was not to be expected that <hi>Camille,</hi> who lov'd more than all the Men in the World, ſhould be in this point more exact than others; ſo that after he had a long time afflicted himſelf on this unhappy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the affairs of his Heart, a deſpair ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; he reſolves to dye rather than depart after that manner. An Adventure ſo happily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, was not to be concluded after ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and it came in his Head that peradventure he ſhould not be ſo unhappy as he did imagine.</p>
                  <p>He did not know what Reaſon the Governour might have to uſe him thus, at the very time that he did overcome him with ſuch Honour and Bounty as out-paſſed what ſuch a Figure as he repreſented might expect: There was great likelyhood that all this came from the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, who upon the Jealouſie which he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of him on the account of the Ring, would not be wanting in employing all his Intereſt with
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:135663:194"/> the Governour to make him quit the City. But he did not know whether the Governour himſelf was not tainted with that Diſeaſe, by reaſon that his Wife had ſhew'd him ſo much kindneſs before him that Morning in the Chappel; ſo that he had been concern'd at it himſelf, and the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour had look'd upon her twice or thrice earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo as to let her underſtand that ſo much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs did not very well pleaſe him. That which did the more confirm him in that Opinion, was the forbidding of him to approach near the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace; ſo that he held it already for certain, that the Reaſons of State and Policy which that Lord had made uſe of to be rid of him, were but the meer Effects of a jealous Temper: He was fully reſolv'd to give him ſatisfaction in that Point with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any trouble to himſelf; for beſides that he was already prepoſſeſs'd with a too beautiful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, too have the leaſt Thought on any other Woman, <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> was not the moſt char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the World in his Eyes, and the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour had not hazarded much in truſting her with him.</p>
                  <p>Part of the Night having been employed in making all thoſe Reflections, without being able to decide poſitively, if his Unhappineſs did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Governour's or the Marqueſſes Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie; he did paſs the remnant of it on the means to write to the Marchioneſs, becauſe that the time preſſed if he were obliged to obey the Governour's Orders. He knew that in
<hi>Spain</hi> the Friars are the ordinary Confidents of the gallant Intrigues, by reaſon of their free acceſs into all Houſes, as a Priviledge annexed unto all Perſons of their Character. He thought that if he could
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:135663:195"/> make an Acquaintance with him that officiated in the Governour's Chappel, he could not doubt of a good Succeſs in his Deſign; for, as to the gaining of him, that was a thing that did not much trouble him. He had learn'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> that thoſe <hi>Friars</hi> who reſiſt the Devil would be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted with Mony; he mention'd, this in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Hoſt, who told him, That he did very well know that worthy Chaplain, and that he would bring him to dine with him, if he deſired it. To begin that way with a <hi>Monk</hi> is to hold the right courſe; the Match is concluded, the Dinner's ready, and the Reverend Father comes with a freſh-coloured face, like a good <hi>Jacobin</hi> as he was. In <hi>Spain</hi> thoſe Perſons do not ſet forth the Poverty of the Country; abundance of Beads, but little Penitence ſerves their turn: They ſit at Table, they eat and drink a little better than in the Refectory: Monſieur, the Pilgrim, plays his part, and the Reverend Father much better his. Friendſhip from the one to the other, Healths and Complements, aſſurances of Services and the fineſt tenderneſs in the World flew about; Drink but once with thoſe Reverend Fathers, and it is an eſtabliſhed Acquaintance even to the next World; and if you have no need of their Service, at leaſt you ſhall have a ſhare in their Prayers whether you will or not. <hi>Camille</hi> did not yet much trouble himſelf to have Prayers ſaid for his Soul; he having ocaſion to make uſe of Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> thus was he named, more as to this World then for the next; at the end of the Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they fell into a Diſcourſe concerning the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour's Court. He found that the Father was perfectly well inſtructed in all things; that he
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:135663:195"/> lodged in the Palace; that he had as great a Power there as any Chaplain could have, and that finally he could better than any Perſon in the World, render him that piece of Service which he deſired; he gave a true byaſs to the buſineſs, takes the good Father aſide, and tells him, that having taken that Habit which he did ſee him wear through a Vow, which he had made to S. <hi>Jago;</hi> he knew that he was obliged to make ſome charitable deeds, to cauſe Prayers to be ſaid in his behalf, and that he did not believe that he could put his charity into better Hands than his; whereupon he drew out of his Pocket a Purſe of Piſtols, of which he gave fifty unto the Reverend Father, who return'd him Curteſie upon Curteſie, mumbling a quantity of words one upon another by way of Thankſgiving and Prayers, of which he ſcarce did underſtand the ſenſe, ſo much did the Rapture that he was in by this magnificent charity tranſport him beyond himſelf.</p>
                  <p>This ſtep being made, which was the moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential in the whole buſineſs. <hi>Now Father,</hi> ſaid <hi>Camille, might I obtain a Favour of you? Alas, Sir,</hi> replyed Father
<hi>Andrew</hi> with much earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>what would not any one do for you. I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you,</hi> continued the Pilgrim, <hi>to be an honeſt and a good Man, and therefore I hope, that in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring this to you in way of Confeſſion, I run no hazard, and that you will ſerve me therein if it lyes in your Power. You know,</hi> continued he, <hi>that within theſe two or three Days there is come into the Palace a certain Lady from</hi> Italy, <hi>who is called the Marchioneſs of</hi> C. <hi>I have ſome buſineſs with her, and cannot get to ſpeak to her, becauſe of her Husband who is very jealous. Jealous,</hi> replyed
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:135663:196"/> Father <hi>Andrew, yea more than any Man in the World. So that I would willingly have a Letter delivered unto her,</hi> continued <hi>Camille, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is no hurt in that. Alas, not in the leaſt,</hi> replyed the ſcrupulous Father, <hi>and you need do no more than to give it me. I do promiſe you, upon the faith of a good Religious, as I am, that you ſhall have an Anſwer before you go to Bed. If it prove ſo,</hi> ſaid
<hi>Camille, there are fifty Piſtols more for Charities. I tell you,</hi> replyed zealous Father
<hi>Andrew, that you ſhall have it, for you are too charitable, and too honeſt a Man not to have your Prayers and Vows granted in Heaven.</hi> This Agreement being made, and there being no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion of Requeſts or Promiſes between them, they alter'd their Diſcourſe; and Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who was as earneſt to go earn the other fifty Piſtols, as
<hi>Camille</hi> was to ſee the Anſwer which the Marchioneſs would make him, ended here his Viſit, and having the Letter, he went to labour to bring about ſo pious a deſign.</p>
                  <p>The buſineſs was not ſo eaſie as he imagin'd, for the Marqueſs, who underſtood ſuch things better than any <hi>Friar</hi> of them all, and who had no great Faith in their Girdle, was continually preſent during the Viſit that this came to give to his Wife; ſo that the good Father <hi>Andrew</hi> did begin to deſpair of getting the other fifty Piſtols that Night, when by good Fortune the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour came in, towards whom the Marqueſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing to receive him, he gave an occaſion to this new Mercury to accompliſh his Meſſage, in ſliding very dextrouſly the Letter into the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs's hand, who looking upon him, did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by ſome ſigns he made, that it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:135663:196"/> of great moment to her, and which it was not requiſite that her Husband ſhould ſee. She withdrew her ſelf into another Chamber, as if ſhe would give a free liberty to theſe Gentlemens En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments, and having opened the Letter, ſhe found it thus.</p>

                        <p>IN that Deſpair, Madam, in which thoſe unjuſt Diſtruſts which you have had of me, has plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me, I defer not to ſeek all the means in the World to Write to you, to offer you once again my Services. You tax of Treachery a Man which would rather periſh a thouſand times than have ſo much as the leaſt Thought of diſpleaſing you. When you will know me better, you will learn that I am not of ſo mean a Rank as to commit any Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs.

If your Ring has cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome Diſorders, at the worſt you may attribute it to ſome Misfortune, but not to any Fault of mine. It fell from your fair Hand without my Knowledge, and the Captain of the Galley who did find it, thinking it was mine, did bring it to me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Marqueſs.

It is time to think on it, for I have but three Days to ſtay in this City, the Governour ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given me Orders, I know not for what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to be gone after that time. I could however find out ſome means to continue longer here, if you
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:135663:197"/> did deſire it. What will not a Lover do for the Object of his Love? I wait your Orders on this.

                  <p>The Marchioneſs, who when opening the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, had had ſome thoughts that it might come from her Pilgrim, was raviſhed with joy at the reading of it, and finding that ſhe had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her ſelf, and in learning the whole ſtory of the Ring. But that which charm'd her moſt, were thoſe tender and paſſionate Sentiments which he expreſſed for her, judging well by the manner of his writing, as alſo by the Air of his Perſon, that he muſt be ſome perſon of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. All that eſteem which ſhe had for him at firſt ſight, did now redouble; he had offer'd himſelf unto her with ſo good a Grace; he had given her to underſtand in ſo ingenious a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the deſign which he had to ſerve her, that that alone was capable to ſeize the heart of a beautiful young Woman, that ſought after that which was offered to her in ſo gallant a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. It is true, that her firſt diſtruſts had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what cool'd her deſires; but beſides that ſhe could condemn him never wholly in her thoughts, ſhe had at laſt in ſome meaſure better inform'd her ſelf, by what ſhe had heard from her Husband, and the wrong which ſhe conceived ſhe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:135663:197"/> had done the Pilgrim on that account, had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but to render him the more worthy of her eſteem: In fine, all things elſe, beſides the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and his Lady, having contributed in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her a thouſand times regret the not having made better uſe of the good intentions of ſo worthy a perſon.

                     </gap> the joy that ſhe received by hearing from him, did wholly diſpoſe her to entertain ſuch thoughts of him as he was worthy of. She would gladly have made him an Anſwer, but as it has been ſaid before, the uſe of writing was not only forbid her as a Capital Crime, but wholly out of her Power. Mean time, as Love is extreme ingenious, and that it appears more in ſuch occaſions than in any others, ſhe bethought her ſelf to write with a Bodkin, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Orange which ſhe had theſe words, <hi>Be-this night at Eleven of the Clock under my Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and you ſhall have my Anſwer;</hi> after which ſhe returned into the Chamber, where was the Governour with the Marqueſs, and Father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,</hi> who would not be gone from thence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome Anſwer to his Letter, after he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the moſt difficult part, which was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of it. The Marchioneſs did look upon him, and ſhewing him the Orange which ſhe ſet upon the Window, ſhe made him ſigns to take it, and that it was all that ſhe had to give him. Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who was a moſt intelligent
<hi>Friar,</hi> gently takes it up, and lifting up his Cowl, he made a moſt humble Reverence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe Gentlemen, and ſo retired, to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs his great ſatisfaction, who was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:135663:198"/> in mind till he did ſee him out of his Apartment.</p>
                  <p>Our devout Poſtilion, but half pleas'd with his Meſſage, for receiving an Orange for his Anſwer, was returning muſing to the Pilgrim, who ſtaid for him at his Lodgings in great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity; he did believe that the good Father had failed of his deſign, ſeeing him coming with a ſomewhat mortified Countenance. <hi>Well Father,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the Marchioneſs is no more viſible to you than ſhe is to others, and doubtleſs that you have not ſpoken to her. I not ſpeak to her!</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> as if angry at the wrong was offered him, and who dares refuſe that to a Director of twenty years ſtanding, Confeſſor to the Lady Governeſs, and Chaplain to my Lord Governour, and a worthy Son of St. <hi>Dominick. Good God!</hi> adde he, raiſing his voice, <hi>and where would you have us to be, in</hi> Barbary?
<hi>No, no Sir Pilgrim,</hi> continued he, while <hi>Camille</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to make his Excuſes with Poſtures and Grimaces, <hi>I have ſeen, I have ſpoken, I have delivered your Letter, it has been read, but for an Anſwer, I have but this Orange to deliver to you,</hi> which he drew out of his Sleeve, <hi>and truly you muſt needs be very unhappy to have no better ſucceſs in this buſineſs, for I always go through with all that I undertake, to the great ſatisfaction of thoſe that employ me.</hi> After that <hi>Camille</hi> had let him know that he was extremely ſatisfied with what he had done, he took the Orange, examin'd it a little better than Father <hi>Andrew</hi> had done, whoſe concern was not ſo great, and preſently he diſcovered the whole Myſtery, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which taking no further notice, he put it in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:135663:198"/> his Pocket, in the room of fifty Piſtols which he took from thence, which the good Father was ſcrupulous to take, ſaying, that in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he could not, and that at the moſt he would have but half, becauſe he had done but half what he had promiſed. Yet at laſt, to oblige ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous a Pilgrim, he was perſwaded to take the whole, deſiring him not to ſpare him in any thing that he ſhould have occaſion for him, and upon that he went his way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Camille,</hi> more full of joy than would be a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that had received an effectual rendezvous, did wait with ſtrange impatiency the hour of that Aſſignation which was appointed him: Prudence would not let him approach the Palace in his Pilgrims Habit, after what the Governour had ſaid to him, but the fear that he had leſt the Marchioneſs ſhould not know him from her Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in another dreſs, or that ſhe durſt not truſt to another, he being by that better diſtinguiſh'd from all other perſons, he reſolv'd not to change his Apparel; ſo that being gone out at a fit hour, he found hlmſelf juſt at eleven before the Palace. Father
<hi>Andrew</hi> had pretty well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd him on which ſide was the Marchioneſſes Appartment, and that her Windows did anſwer upon the Sea; ſo that he could not miſtake. He gets under them, and perceiving ſome light in them, he goes behind a Pillar till the Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs ſhould appear and make him ſome ſign. In ſuch buſineſſes time ſeems long, every moment lengthens; and it ſeemed to <hi>Camille,</hi> who had his Eyes faſtened to thoſe Windows, that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready waited a long time, when at laſt he did ſee a Lady appear, and as he imagin'd, it could
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:135663:199"/> be none but the Marchioneſs: He immediately ſteps out of his lurking place and ſhew'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He was preſently known by the Shells and other gaudy things which Pilgrims uſually wear on their Hats, which glittered in thoſe bright Nights that are common in thoſe Countries in the Summer Seaſon; and ſoon after the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow was ſhut again. He thought that it was not yet time, but a quarter of an hour after he ſaw a little door opened, whence there came forth an ancient <hi>Duenna,</hi> who call'd him, and made him go in, ſaying, in a low Voice, that all that day they had been concerned for him, that he had been ſought for all over the Town, and that they had but juſt eſpy'd him from the Window; he was advis'd to be diſcreet and wiſe, and that he ſhould be the happieſt of all Men. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon taking him by the hand, ſhe led him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out light through an obſcure way till they were come into a low room very like that of ſome old waiting Woman, in a corner of which there was a Lamp burning, there being nothing elſe in it but a Bed, and that none of the beſt, two Flag-Chairs, and a Trunk, which it is probable did ſerve for a Wardrobe. She buſily told him that he ſhould ſtay a little, and that when all things ſhould be ready to receive him, ſhe would fetch him. Happy <hi>Camille,</hi> not daring to make the leaſt noiſe, all tranſported with joy and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments, did only kiſs twice or thrice her hand, making her ſigns that ſhe might be gone, and that he would ſtay there till ſhe came again: upon this the <hi>Duenna,</hi> who knew with what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiency ſhe was expected back, that the reſult of her Commiſſion might be known, did get up
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:135663:199"/> a Ladder which was in the Room, and went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Chamber over it through a Trap-door, to give an accout of what ſhe had done.</p>
                  <p>To conceive well the condition that the Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Camille</hi> was in at that time, one ſhould Love as much as he did. He was ſenſible that the Marchioneſs did ſhew him more favour than ever he could have hoped for, and that when he thought his buſineſs deſperate, on the ſudden he did find himſelf upon the very moment of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the happieſt of all men. Theſe reflections rais'd his Thoughts and Idea's, repreſenting to himſelf the beauteous Marchioneſs, ſome time after one manner, ſometime after another, who told him this, to which he anſwer'd; that thus reliſhing beforehand ſuch charming pleaſures, that nothing but the reality of what he did ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine could afford him greater; ſo long as the heat of his Amorous ravings could afford him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny matter of entertainment, time did not ſeem long to him; and ſetting aſide ſome little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiences which from time to time did ſeize on him, he did ſpend paſſably well ſome moments in that dull Chamber; but when it began to be long before the old Woman did return, and that he had begun to fear ſome back ſtroak of Fortune or of Love, his Fancy repreſenting to him every moment ſome misfortune or other, he felt no longer any thing of the former ſweets. He had almoſt been two hours dancing Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and had already gone above a thouſand times about the Chamber, which he had viſited, to divert himſelf from one end to the other, there not being a Rag, or Clowt, Shell of red, Pot of <hi>Pomatum,</hi> with which that Trunk was
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:135663:200"/> filled, which had not paſs'd through his hands, and wherein he had not thruſt his Noſe. He already did no longer hope for any thing of what he had promiſed to himſelf, and was very fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of paſſing the Night upon that Trunk; for as to the Bed, he fear'd too much the ſmell and Society of it, when at laſt he did ſee the Trap-door lifted up, and the <hi>Duenna</hi> to appear, who made him ſigns to come up; Preſently he re-aſſumes his joy, and in two or three ſteps flies up to the Trap-door; he beholds a magnificent Chamber, enlightened but with one ſingle Flambeau, which was placed upon the Table. The <hi>Duenna</hi> made him a ſign that he ſhould go to the Wall-ſide of the Bed, he advances with redoubling joys of Love which he could hardly contain in his heart, and drawing near to the Bed where lay the Lady with the Curtains drawn, he caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon his Knees before her, who received him with no leſſ paſſion. At the firſt on-ſet there was nothing but Traſports and Tenderneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on both parts, ſighs on this part, ſighs on the other. <hi>Ah Madam,</hi> cry'd out <hi>Camille</hi> twice or thrice in a languiſhing accent, <hi>what Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, what Favours do I receive at preſent from you?</hi> He was not able to ſay any more in the joy he had. Mean time the old <hi>Duenna,</hi> who had no more buſineſs there, went out of the Chamber to keep Centry for fear of a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſal. The Lady, who had ſeen ſufficiently this languiſhing Lover, kneeling, being impatient that he ſhould riſe to an higher degree of Fortune, having no time to loſe, deſired him with a ſigh to ariſe and ſit down by her; that the Governour was playing with the Marqueſs, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:135663:200"/> that it would not be long before he would be coming. <hi>Camille,</hi> ſurpris'd with this diſcourſe, and to hear ſo good <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſpoken by a Lady of his Country who was not likely to underſtand it ſo well, opens his Eyes, diſcerns through the Curtains ſome other Features than thoſe of the Marchioneſs, and in lieu of her he finds the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours Wife, whoſe Cornets, Ribbons, Curls, and all the other Adjuſtments with which ſhe had bedeck'd her ſelf as a new Bride, had at firſt ſight deceived him through the aid of the ſmall light that came into the Bed; what a change did this miſtake produce in him? His Joy and Tranſports are preſently chang'd into a dull ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, he looks up towards Heaven as if it had been the Author of his miſhap, and at the ſame time turning his Head another way, in lieu of riſing, as the Lady did bid him, he lets himſelf drop upon the Bed, with his Head leaning on his Arms, as if he would hide the Confuſion that he was in through that piece of Treachery which Love had lately play'd him. The Lady, much troubled to ſee him in this poſture, after ſuch a Tender and Paſſionate beginning, enquires what he aileth, and whether he finds himſelf ill? He makes no Anſwer, ſhe takes him by the Arm, draws him towards her, and finds him to be grown cold and indifferent, which ſurpriſes and frets her. Never were perſons more puſled; ſhe repeats her Careſſes, and intreats him to tell her what he has found in her that ſhould on the ſudden diſguſt him. She ſees that he ſighs, but it is for ſorrow, and not out of Love. At laſt he riſes and intreats of her that he may retire. <hi>Retire!</hi> reply'd ſhe, with trembling a Voice, <hi>and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:135663:201"/> can you leave me in this manner? Ah! how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy am I?</hi> continued ſhe, holding an Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief before her Eyes to hide the Confuſion that ſhe was in, and to receive ſome Tears which ſhe could not retain. <hi>What,</hi> added ſhe, <hi>muſt I ſee myſelf thus ſlighted by a perſon to whom I have abandoned my Life and Honour!</hi> And finding that neither her Tears, nor any thing elſe that ſhe could ſay to him, of moſt tender, did move him, and that he ſtill did perſiſt in the deſign of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring,
<hi>Ungrateful man,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him with a ſorrow mixed with fury, <hi>carry not thy cruelty ſo far, for thou wouldeſt abandon me to all that rage can make a Perſon of my Quality and Courage do, when ſhe finds her ſelf treated as thou uſeſt me. Speak, draw near, and at leaſt tell me ſomething that may allay the effects of thy contempt. The Governour is not far from hence, and if thou ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeſt me to make ſome noiſe thou art loſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who ever elſe had been in <hi>Camille</hi>'s room, had peradventure more Complaiſance for a Lady, who though none of the handſomeſt, might well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſomewhat leſs of Rigour to be ſhewn to her, that doth never become a young Man; but yet again when one is prepoſſeſſed with ſuch a ſtrong Paſſion as he was, and that in lieu of a charming Beauty which has been long expected and thought to be in poſſeſſion, an Object is met with which was not ſought after, it becomes the more hateful, and the Heart being grieved at ſuch a Deceit, it takes up quite contrary Thoughts to the former, and it is very difficult to reclaim it. However <hi>Camille,</hi> who look'd upon himſelf as a Priſoner in the Power of a tranſported Woman who could really ruine him, did at laſt make uſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:135663:201"/> of his Prudence; he did not drive her to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, and thinking on ſome more handſom put off than that of a Diſguſt, he was preparing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to make her ſome Excuſes upon a Faintneſs of Heart which had ſeiz'd on him, when the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi> came in great haſte to tell them, that the Game was at an end, and the Governour coming; ſo that all that <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> could do, was to embrace once more that inſenſible Lover, which in that very moment did force ſome Expreſſions of Kindneſs to comfort her a little, ſeeing himſelf upon the point of being rid of her. <hi>If you will not,</hi> ſaid ſhe,
<hi>put into Deſpair a Perſon that has ſo much Paſſion as I have for you, render your ſelf to morrow at the ſame Hour where I did ſee you this Night.</hi> She had no time to ſay more to him, becauſe that ſhe heard the Governour co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; ſo that the <hi>Duenna</hi> had but juſt time ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to open the Trap-door, and go out with <hi>Camille,</hi> and that with ſuch precipitation, that her Coats being between as ſhe let it down again, and the Ladder which was not very faſt, having ſlid from under them by their haſty motion in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off, the Pilgrim fell with his Breech to the Ground, and the old Woman remain'd hung in the Air by her Coats, which was the pleaſanteſt ſight that could be. She durſt not make any noiſe, for fear of being heard by the Governour; and ſhe was making ſign to the Pilgrim to help her to get looſe; but notwithſtanding the croſs adventure which he had ſo lately had, and that in which ſhe had ſhear'd with the <hi>Duenna,</hi> he did break out into ſuch a laughter at the dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of her Legs, that he was a long time not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to riſe. He would gladly have left her
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:135663:202"/> in that poſture to be reveng'd of the cruel meſſage which ſhe had lately delivered to him, by which he had loſt the Rendezvous which he had from the Marchioneſs, and perhaps the opportunity of ever having another; but having occaſion for this old Woman to convey him from thence, he was obliged much againſt his will to aſſiſt her; yet it was not without conſidering of her very exactly, before and behind, and laughing heartily at her, which made the <hi>Duenna</hi> ſtorm at him, and promiſe him to revenge her ſelf if ever he came again. <hi>Camille</hi> did not trouble himſelf at her Threats, being very ſorry to have been catched once there. Being led out, he paſſed once again before the Windows of the Marchioneſſes Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but could ſee no more light there, and ſmall hopes of having any till day; yet he walked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them for ſome time, ſighing, thinking and complaing of Love, and of that hard fate which had ſo untowardly thrown him into the Arms of an homely Woman; yet in the midſt of all theſe regrets, the pleaſant Reflections which he did make upon his miſtake on the tranſports of the Governeſs, and on the <hi>Duenna</hi>'s Adventure, did ſomewhat divert him. But it was time to go to Bed, not to ſleep; for that's not for Lovers, but to think what he ſhould do to repair that Nights miſcarriage.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as it was Day he ſent too ſeek after the moſt dear Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> from whom he kept ſecret what had befallen him with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour's Wife; it not becoming a well-bred Man to divulge ſuch things; he only told him that he was the moſt unfortunate of all Men, and that if he did not take pity of him, his deſpair
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:135663:202"/> would not let him live twenty four hours. The obliging Father
<hi>Andrew,</hi> impatient to learn in what he could ſerve him, imagining that it would not be unrewarded, did conjure him not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, but to be perſwaded, that if his happineſs did depend on him only, he would make him the moſt happy Perſon in the World. After this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and true proteſtation, <hi>Camille</hi> told him, that if he would have him obliged to him of his life, which was much more than of his good Fortune, he muſt that day deliver a Letter to the Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs, and endeavour by all means poſſible to bring him an Anſwer: That he would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his kindneſs ſo as that he ſhould have cauſe to be contented, and not repine at the little pains he ſhould take for him. <hi>Alas, fie, Sir, pray have no ſuch thought,</hi> ſaid the Father, ſmilingly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting him. <hi>You know that we are in this World but to ſerve one another, and I do not believe there is any one that taketh more delight in obliging Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons than I do. Give me that Letter,</hi> added he, <hi>and only pray to God that I may find the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs alone, and I promiſe to return you ſuch an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer as you would deſire; but be the Marqueſs there or not, I will not return without bringing you news from the Marchioneſs, and deliver your Letter unto her;</hi> and without more Words, he takes leave of him, and goes to ſet the Irons in the Fire.</p>
                  <p>The Marchioneſs had been all Night in no leſs trouble than <hi>Camille;</hi> ſhe had in the Evening feign'd her ſelf ſomewhat ill, that ſhe might ſtay in her Chamber, and not loſe the opportunity of the Appointment which ſhe had made to the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim, but that pretended Indiſpoſition had not
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:135663:203"/> had the effect which ſhe expected; for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and his Lady, being come to keep her Company, did paſs the greateſt part of the Night with her, the Governour at play with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, and <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> in Diſcourſe with her; ſo that ſhe never durſt draw near to the Window, for fear of giving them any Diſtruſt in caſe the Pilgrim ſhould appear and be ſeen; as indeed it happened unto the Governour's Wife, which had preſently known him, and made uſe of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as has been related. And the Marchioneſs was no ſooner quit of the Lady, but ſhe went al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to the Window, but there was no Pilgrim there, ſhe look'd every way, and waited for him with the the greateſt Impatiency and Trouble imaginable, fearing that he might have been wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with waiting ſo long. The Game being end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at laſt, and the jealous Marqueſs, who had twice or thrice obſerved with what aſſiduity his ſick Wife did ſtay at the Window, had played with a very diſtracted mind, every moment turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his head towards her, as if he fear'd ſome Gallant ſhould get up that way; ſo that the Governour was no ſooner got out of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but that he went himſelf to ſee what was the matter, he look'd out, and after he had been ſome time there, not ſeeing any thing, he ſhut the Window with a great deal of caution.</p>
                  <p>The beautiful Marchioneſs was in ſuch a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly for having fail'd the Pilgrim, that ſhe could have no reſt all that night. Her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band who did not always ſleep, when he ſeem'd ſo to do, and who had fancy'd that certainly his Wife had had ſome evil deſign that Evening, was more than ever confirm'd in that Opinion, when
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:135663:203"/> he heard her from time to time to vent moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſighs. There needed no great matter to puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle his Brains; and this wicked Pilgrim did ſo run in his mind ſince the Adventure of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, that he had no other Dreams every Night but of Palmer ſtaves, Cockle ſhell Hats, and the like, which made him be in a continual fear; he would come every day at Maſs in the Palace-Chappel where he had no buſineſs; he did inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate himſelf into the Governour's Favour, to render him a Viſit; wherefore all this, thought he, if it were not on my Wifes account? who, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpos'd as ſhe was, did watch two or three hours at the Window to ſee him paſs by. Thus did he reaſon within himſelf; if by laying his hand on her left ſide he could have made her declare in her ſleep all that ſhe had in her Heart; Oh, what a Triumph that had been for him! but he had already a thouſand times made tryal of that ſecret without advantage. After this he lay reproaching of himſelf for having continued ſo long at play, while he ſhould have been minding his buſineſs; for, ſaid he to himſelf, with a Sex ſo perfideous as that is, let a poor Man forget himſelf but one moment, and he is lyable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive during that time the greateſt Affront that can ever happen to him. Having paſs'd the beſt part of the Night in tormenting himſelf after this manner, he got up in the Morning, his Head ſo fill'd with the thoughts of this Pilgrim, that he fancied to ſee him in every Perſon that came into the Chamber. Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who was one of the firſt that came to viſit him, though he diſſembled never ſo much, approaching him in a Saint-like poſture, with a wry Neck, his hands
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:135663:204"/> in his great Sleeves, and a down look, he was received by the Marqueſs rather worſe than the Day before. For after he had ſhew'd him a Mien cold enough to freeze the fiery heat of the moſt Zealot of all Intreagues, he heard him ſpeak du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring more than an hour that they walked together in the Hall, without affording him any other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer than <hi>yea</hi> or <hi>nay,</hi> with which Father <hi>Andrew</hi> grew at laſt weary, and finding that he could not get him by any means to enter into a Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he took the liberty to ask him how the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Marchioneſs did, and whether he ſhould not have the honour to give her the good morrow.
<hi>No, Father,</hi> reply'd the Marqueſs, very coldly, <hi>ſhe is not very well, and you will excuſe her for this time. Heaven! how ſorry am I at it?</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the good Father, <hi>it is at ſuch times, as when we are viſited, that we ſtand in moſt need of a wiſe Directors Conſolations; and with your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, my Lord,</hi> added he, <hi>ſeeing that Heaven hath ſent me as it were on purpoſe, I will have her ask'd, if without diſturbing I could not ſpeak ſome Words of Conſolation unto her. You will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly diſquiet her, Father,</hi> did he reply. <hi>But if ſhe had occaſion to confeſs her ſelf,</hi> continued the ghoſtly Director. <hi>She is not yet ſo ill,</hi> anſwer'd the Marqueſs, <hi>and it is not eight Days ſince ſhe was at Confeſſion. It is no matter,</hi> went on the Father, going towards the Marchioneſſes Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>one knows not what may happen.</hi> She ſleeps, ſaid the other, detaining him, and this is not fit time. <hi>How? does ſhe ſo?</hi> ſaid the zealous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>then I will wait till ſhe awakens,</hi> and you— Father, without any more ado, ſaid the Jealous Lord, interrupting of him ſomewhat roughly, his
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:135663:204"/> patience being at an end, I tell you, that here is no need of you, and that you will oblige me, not to come here again till you are ſent for. <hi>Sir, it is not uſual to treat a Man of my Orders in ſuch a manner,</hi> replyed Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> without being daunted, <hi>in ſpeaking to me ſo roughly, you offend a whole Order,</hi> that might—I ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Pope, and the whole Church, ſaid the angry Marqueſs interrupting him, with a longing deſire to break the Friars bald Pate, if the Pope and the Church would ſee my Wife againſt my Will: and ſaying this he left his Reverence, and withdrew himſelf into his Wifes Chamber, and ſhut the Door after him.</p>
                  <p>The poor Father <hi>Andrew</hi> extreamly confus'd and vex'd at the Marqueſs his Bruitiſhneſs, retir'd very penſive, but fully reſolv'd to find ſome way of Revenge; thinking himſelf unworthy of his Monkiſh Character, if he did not make him wear a pair of Fair ones. He returned to the Pilgrim with a moſt ſorrowful Countenance, and in giving him an account of the manner that that Brute had us'd him (for ſo he qualify'd the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs) he did ſufficiently expreſs his Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, proteſting, that were it not for the Habit he wore, he would have made him that which he feared ſo much to be. That exceſs of Cholar made
<hi>Camille</hi> to laugh, maugre all the Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent he was in at his Embaſſy's ill Succeſs. He entreated the Father to rely on him as to the point Revenge, only deſiring his Aſſiſtance to bring it about. That I fully reſolve, anſwered Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> and though it ſhould coſt me the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Piſtols that I have received from you, I muſt and will ſpeak to the Marchioneſs this very day,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:135663:205"/> and give you an account of this Letter. <hi>Camille,</hi> who was not ignorant of thoſe Confraters Subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, very much rejoycing to ſee him take ſuch a Reſolution, told him, to animate him the more, that in caſe thoſe Hundred Piſtols were employed in his Service, he ſhould meet with another hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at his return, and more too, if he had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for them. Liberality is one of the moſt advantagious and ſureſt Qualities of a Lover. Moſt commonly it ſtands in the place of Merit, and perſwades much better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That which Love cannot do in a long time, Money will perform ſome time in a moment. Father
<hi>Andrew,</hi> in whom a coveteous humour did predominate above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, did find himſelf engaged by ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful an Intereſt to ſerve ſo brave a Pilgrim as not to omit, ſetting on work all that he knew of ſubtilty and intreague. Vengeance and hope of a new Preſent were too ſtrongly joyned together to fail; upon ſuch good ſecurity he would have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken the moſt difficult things in the World. He goes to <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> whoſe Confeſſor he was, as we have already ſaid, ſo that he knew the very Soul of her; he counterfeits a troubled Mind, that he might be ask'd what it was that diſquieted him. The Lady falls in his Trap, ſhe entreats and preſſes him divers times to tell her what was the matter; and at laſt he informs her, that the Marqueſs is jealous of the Governour; and that having been in his apartment to viſit the Marchioneſs, who he had heard was fallen ill, he had us'd him not as a Confeſſor, or his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies Chaplain; but as a Meſſenger concern'd in the Governours Amours, not giving him the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſee her. <hi>Signora Donna Barbara,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:135663:205"/> to the uſual cuſtom of Women, who will be themſelves jealous of their Husbands, but will not ſuffer others to be ſo, did take in great diſdain the Marqueſs his diſtruſts, not thinking her ſelfleſs worthy than his Wife. Thus being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with thoſe firſt tranſports, ſhe did ſpeak with ſo much ſcorn of the Husbands extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the Wifes want of Merit, that ſhe gave occaſion to Father <hi>Andrew</hi> to deſcant upon that Theme alſo, and ſay to her, all that could incenſe her and make her of his Party. <hi>Nay, ſince it is ſo,</hi> ſaid <hi>Donna Barbara, and that this Lord is ſo apt to ſee Viſions, only becauſe my Husband is more civil, and better underſtands what is due to Ladies than he, he ſhall be made jealous in good earneſt, and we will make our ſelves ſome ſport with him. If you will ſerve me in it, Father</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, added ſhe, ſmiling,
<hi>we ſhall both revenge our ſelves moſt pleaſantly.</hi> Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who deſired nothing more, made anſwer that he was ready to obey her, in all that ſhe would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to command him; and upon that ſhe told him that ſhe would think on it, and did bid him come again to her towards the Evening a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before Supper, of which he fail'd not, and
<hi>Donna Barbara</hi> found him in her Chamber wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for her; ſhe laugh'd ſo ſoon as ſhe ſaw him, and asked him, if he could act very well a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants part; for he ſhould ſee that Night the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs in ſuch a Garb; at this, Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> taking upon him to aſſume a good Meen, was willing to let the Lady ſee, that he had not quite forgot what he had formerly been, and what he yet could be upon occaſion: At which poſtures <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> laughing out-right, ſhe ſent him
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:135663:206"/> to one of her Husbands <hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> to whom ſhe had before given order to fit him <hi>Cap-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe,</hi> like a Gentleman, and ſhe told Father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,</hi> that when he ſhould be ready, he ſhould go into the Garden, and keep himſelf in the
<hi>Grotto</hi> of the <hi>Nayades,</hi> where ſhe ſhould meet him with the Marchioneſs. Father <hi>Andrew</hi> o're-joy'd with a deſign ſo favourable to his deſires, did ſhout with joy at ſo pretty a deſign, and did much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud the Ladies ingenuity. Go and prepare your ſelf to act your part well, ſaid the Marchioneſs; for now that the Governour is not here, doubtleſs the Marqueſs will accompany us into the Garden, which will furniſh us no doubt with ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther divertiſement, and you with a fit occaſion of revenge. But Madam, reply'd Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who had no mind that the concluſion of the Play ſhould light on him, I would not have this Lord to miſtake himſelf; for I know how furious he is, and you can teſtifie, Madam, that I have no hand in this, further then to obey your commands: Go, reply'd ſhe, and fear not any thing where I ſhall be.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Father <hi>Andrew</hi> goes to the <hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> who did take care to accommodate him; and <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> having ſupped, ſhe went as ſhe us'd to do every Evening, to walk in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with the Marchioneſs, where the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs did not fail to accompany them. But becauſe the Governour was not there, the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Cuſtom not permitting him to entertain the Ladies, for fear of giving Jealouſie, he went to walk in another place of the Garden, however ſtill having his Eyes on them, for fear of ſome ſurprize. Madam, ſaid
<hi>Donna Barbara</hi>

As ſhe ended theſe Words, and not above two or three ſteps from the <hi>Grotto of the Nayades,</hi> they ſaw come forth a Cavalier in a magnificent dreſs, which did as much ſurpriſe the Marchioneſs, as all that <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:135663:207"/> newly ſaid unto her. She would preſently have retired, fearing it was ſome trick put upon her; but the Governours Lady ſtopt her. <hi>Good Madam,</hi> ſaid the Marchioneſs, <hi>permit me to retire I beſeech you, or I ſhall have cauſe to complain of you.</hi> But <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> had no ſooner ſeen Father <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Figure, but ſhe burſt out into ſuch a laughter as would not give her leave to anſwer her. At which the Marchioneſs ſtrangely confounded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that ſhe was certainly played upon, would by all means be gone, not intending to be an object to the divertiſement of the Governors La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. On the other hand Father <hi>Andrew</hi> did make moſt ridiculous poſtures in imitation of a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Air, and did ſpeak ſuch pleaſant things to the Marchioneſs to undeceive her, and oblige her to ſtay, that <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> was e'en ſpent with laughing, and the Marchioneſs began to be angry in good earneſt, not deſigning to anſwer, or ſo much as turn her Eyes towards the Cavalier; who ſeeing that <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> could detain her no longer, was at laſt conſtrained to ask her if ſhe knew no longer Father <hi>Andrew.</hi> Never was a confuſion equal to that of the Marchioneſs, who at the Name of Father <hi>Andrew</hi> having caſt her Eyes upon him, did preſently know him, and was for ſometime ſo diſordered within her ſelf, that ſhe knew not what to ſay, not knowing to what purpoſe <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> had brought her that Fryer, without he had intruſted her with what had paſſed between her and the Pilgrim: but ſhe was preſently undeceived as to that; for the Governours Lady, who thought that ſhe had ſufficiently laught at the Marchioneſs's coſt, not willing to let her remain any longer in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:135663:207"/> that ſhe ſeem'd to be in, did relate unto her how that all this Comedy had been invented meerly to revenge her ſelf of her Husbands jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, who would not allow that any one ſhould ſee her: And as ſhe was thus ſpeaking, Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who was upon the watch, and who not without cauſe was more in fear than any body elſe, did a far off eſpy the Marqueſs, who was advancing towards them with a round pace: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he was alarmed, and would fain have been a going; but <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> did embolden him again, and advis'd them both to go into the <hi>Grotto,</hi> while ſhe would go meet the Marqueſs, to undeceive him; but that the opportunity was too fair not to throughly revenge her ſelf by it. The Marchioneſs, who would willingly have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven half her life to ſpeak with Father
<hi>Andrew,</hi> was ſo ſurpris'd with joy, at the opportunity which <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> gave her of it, that ſhe thought of nothing but to make good uſe of that happy moment.</p>
                  <p>The Marqueſs had all along kept the Avenue, having walked before the Garden-gate to obſerve thoſe that ſhould go in or out; when having caſt his eyes on that ſide that the Ladies were, he had ſeen certain feathers appear, which had moſt terribly affrighted him; and quite out of breath at the ſight of that Viſion, he was run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as faſt as he could that way, to ſee what it was, and know whether his eyes deceived him or not: But <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> meeting him, did detain him, and enquired whether he went ſo faſt: <hi>Leave me, Madam,</hi> ſaid he, with ſo great a perplexity that he could ſcarce ſpeak, <hi>for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſake let me go, for I have ſeen all, and your
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:135663:208"/> company is too dangerous for my Wife. Why?</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd ſhe, <hi>what is't you fear? She is with my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who we have found hid in the</hi> Grotto <hi>of the</hi> Nyades. <hi>How? She is with your Husband,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Marqueſs more aſtoniſh'd than ever, <hi>and you can have the patience, Madam, to leave them alone thus? What,</hi> reply'd ſhe,
<hi>you'd have me be there as a Property? That is not my humour; and if</hi> Monſieur <hi>the Governour, who as you know has ever been wanton enough, will play me foul play, I ſhall ſooner forgive him for making choice of ſo pretty a Lady as is the Marchioneſs, than if he ſhould make uſe of ſome other leſs deſerving: And I find,</hi> reply'd the Marqueſs in a fury,
<hi>that what you now ſay, is the moſt terrible thing in the World, and that an honeſt Woman ought to give Poyſon to a Husband that ſhould have the leaſt thought of ſuch a thing.</hi> In ſpeaking thus, he was ſo diſtracted, that he knew not what to do: He would go two or three ſteps forwards, and then as many back, dragging <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> after him, who ſtill had hold of him, and had much to do to follow him: <hi>Will you not then,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him,
<hi>go and ſee what they do, ſeeing you are reſiſtleſs. No, Madam,</hi> anſwer'd he roughly, retiring back, <hi>for I have ſeen but too much already; and ſince that the Rights of Hoſpitality are violated here, and that under the pretence of Parentage a Man of my Quality is diſhonour'd, I muſt have a recourſe to thoſe that can do me Juſtice in this caſe, and I will periſh rather than not be righted.</hi> He did ſpeak thoſe Words with ſuch a tranſport, and ſo loud, that Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who was not far from thence, having heard him, thought that he was juſt upon him, which made him gallop away as
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:135663:208"/> faſt as he could to the Back-door, of which <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Barbara</hi> had given him the Key.</p>
                  <p>The Marqueſs was going back to the Palace wholly tranſported with fury, revolving a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand deſigns of vengeance in his Mind againſt this treacherous Kinſman the Governour: When he was ſcarce got to the firſt Gallery which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd into the Garden, where he met him with ſome Officers. How great his ſurprize was, is eaſie to be imagined; and ſeeing him come up to him with a chearful ſmiling countenance, he ſtood looking on him without ſaying one Word. The Governour more ſurpris'd, than he himſelf, at his behaviour, and to ſee him ſo pale and wan, did ask him what he ailed: <hi>What, my Lord,</hi> ſaid the Marqueſs,
<hi>did I not ſee you but even now in the Garden ſpeaking to my Wife, near the</hi> Grotto
<hi>of the</hi> Nayades? <hi>No aſſuredly,</hi> replyed the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, <hi>for I have been ever ſince morning in the</hi> Arcenal, <hi>to haſten the fitting out of ſome Veſſels for</hi> Sicily, <hi>and I am but juſt come in.</hi> The jealous Marqueſs had no ſooner heard this, but that the fumes of his paſſion confounding his ſenſes more than ever, he return'd into the Garden almoſt diſtracted, where the Governour, who did ſee him ſo tranſported, did follow him, preſſing him ſeveral times to declare what he ailed, and where he was going, without being able to get one Word from him, till they had found the Ladies that were walking and laughing ſtill at the Adventure, againſt whom he vented part of his rage, running down his Wife with ſuch ill language, in which <hi>Donna Barbara</hi>'s Honour was not a little concern'd. The Governour did hear all that without one Word ſpeaking, being in an extreme impatiency
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:135663:209"/> to learn the cauſe of all thoſe tranſports: But the Ladies, who continued laughing at the Marqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes fury, did increaſe it much at the Governours amazement, unto whom, when the jealous Man was retired, they gave an account of all that had paſſed.</p>
                  <p>Mean time the furious Marqueſs was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perplexed, to gueſs who that Cavalier ſhould be that he had ſeen with his Wife in the Garden, there being no likelihood that it ſhould be the Governour: So that after he had ſufficiently tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented himſelf on that Theme, he having always his imagination fill'd with the Pilgrim, and that he could think of no other Perſon on whom he might more certainly lay his Conjectures, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that it was he, and that
<hi>Sennora Donna Barbara,</hi> who had always taken that Traytors part, had had him ſecretly convey'd into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, there to entertain his Wife. There was but little Ground for all that, and it was very unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that a Lady, as was the Governours Wife, ſhould ſtoop ſo low: But of what ſtrange Idea's is not a jealous Mans fancy capable? He did confirm him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo well in that Opinion, through a thouſand falſe reaſonings which he made upon it, that he no longer doubted it ſo, that he took the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to rid himſelf of a Man ſo fatal to his quiet as was that Perſon: Yet ſome checks of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, (for <hi>Spaniards</hi> have it very tender,) making him to reflect with ſome ſcruples on an act in which a Chriſtian Soul was concern'd, he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude to examin the buſineſs a little better firſt: And thereupon he was framing a deſign moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, to inform himſelf of the whole truth; which was, to diſguiſe himſelf like a Pilgrim, as
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:135663:209"/> he might eaſily do in a Country where there are Shops full of ſuch Garments to ſell, and then to walk under his own Chamber-window, where his Wife would not fail to appear, as ſhe had done the Night before, and ſo be trepann'd: This being reſolv'd upon, as has been ſaid, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Night to draw near, ſo that he had no time to loſe, if he would get all things ready before the Marchioneſs ſhould be return'd from her walk, he ſent one of his Servants to fetch him a Pilgrims Habit; and having plac'd two other of his Servants over againſt his Chamber to keep Centry, if occaſion were, and to give him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all things, he withdrew himſelf, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the return of his Servant.</p>
                  <p>Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who through the impatiency he was in to carry thoſe good news to the Pilgrim, which he had to tell him, together with the fear that the Marqueſs had put him in, had not had time to go and ſhift himſelf, but was running as faſt as he could towards his moſt Dear's Lodgings with that Hat loaden with Feathers, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times flapt of one ſide of his Head, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hung on the other: Beſides the Peruque which did infinitely annoy him, and made him ſweat more than ever had done two Cowls made of Serge; but above all, the Belt, which was ſo long, that the Sword dragg'd on the ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forc'd to carry it in one hand, and to hold his Hat with the other. He did croſs in this dreſs the beſt part of the City, not without frequently looking behind him, to ſee if ſome body did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, ſtill fearing the Marqueſs his anger, though he was far enough: At laſt he came to the Pilgrims Lodging, who unfortunately was not
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:135663:210"/> at home. This makes him mad, he muſt find him out; that which he has to ſay to him is of too great a conſequence to be omitted; it cannot be deferr'd, and there is not a moment to be loſt: He runs to and fro, here and there, knowing that his ſteps would be very well rewarded, and that thereby his zeal would the more appear, but no Pilgrim to be found. He had been ſeeking of him two hours, and was ready to return the ſecond time to his Lodgings, but firſt he would go round the Palace, not being far from thence, to ſee if he might not be ſtaid there; when paſſing under the Windows of the Marqueſs his Apartment, he ſaw a Pilgrim walking, and that ſeem'd to come towards him. It was ſomewhat dark, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd that he ſhould hardly know him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore running towards him to embrace him, <hi>You have given me,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>a great deal of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble this day; you ſee in what an Equipage I am ſtill, but you ſhall never know in what dangers I have hazarded my life for your ſake. In a word,</hi> continued he in a low voice, <hi>the beauteous Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs is yours, and this very Night, if you can get a Ladder of Ropes, ſhe will follow you whereſoever you ſhall pleaſe to lead her: I have a Letter of hers to give you, in which you will ſee more; but let us from hence.</hi> As Father <hi>Andrew</hi> was talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after this manner, he perceiv'd a certain piece of Iron to glitter, with which the Pilgrim was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reward him after an ill manner for his good ſervices, if he had not happily eſcaped the blow, by ſuddenly recollecting himſelf, ſeeing his errour, and running away; yet not ſo quickly, but that he left the Hat, Feathers, and Peruque in the others hands, who thought to hold him faſt by
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:135663:210"/> them: <hi>Ah! thou Villain,</hi> cryed he, <hi>is it thus that thou performeſt thy Religious Vows? Thou infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Hypocrite, Haſt thou taken upon thee a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Habit, but for the more ſecure debauching another mans Wife?</hi> Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who had not been ſo ſurpris'd at the ſhining of the Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as he was at the hearing of the Marqueſs his voice, did ſet all his ſtrength in his heels, and little minding the Sermon which was preach'd to him, he left not running till he was come to the Pilgrims Houſe. The Marqueſs, who was not ſo good a Foot-man, left running after him, being well ſatisfied with having found out the bottom of the Plot, eſpecially the Marchioneſſes good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. He was only vexed that had been too haſty, elſe he might have had the Letter alſo, which had been the way to have convinced her ſo home, that ſhe ſhould have had nothing to ſay for her ſelf: Yet he did not wholly deſpair of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it, in continuing to act the Pilgrims part, and walking under the Windows of her Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: He was ſcarce return'd thither, but the
<hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi> of <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> who had ever ſince morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepared as ſevere a Revenge for <hi>Camille</hi> as could be imagin'd, fail'd not to let fall upon the Marqueſs his Head, from a third ſtory, a whole deluge of filth, with which he was cover'd all over. <hi>Oh Heavens! muſt I receive this affront too,</hi> ſaid he, lifting up his Head, to ſee from whence that Preſent came, <hi>to fill up my meaſure of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes?</hi> And without ſtaying to make needleſs complaints, and not being able to endure the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſtink with which he was perfum'd, he went back to the Palace to ſhift himſelf, and in the ſame time gave ſuch Orders, ſo that the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:135663:211"/> ſhould not take effect; but as he was going into that Chamber in which he was to leave all his Equipage, the Governour, who with his Wife was accompanying the Marchioneſs, did eſpy him; and having judg'd by his countenance that it was ſome body that would hide himſelf, he did ask of him who carred the <hi>Flambeau,</hi> who it was; who made him Anſwer, that he thought it was the Marqueſs: At which they all fell to laugh; and <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> who ſought by all means to make him ſtark mad, did oblige his Lady, who was very indifferent, and the Governour, who out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance did follow them, to go with her into that Chamber where they found him, having ſtill the Hat and Peruque of that moſt wicked Father
<hi>Andrew</hi> in one hand, and the Palmers ſtaff in the other; but their preſence was to him the moſt grievous of all affictions, not thinking that they had ſeen him. They ail gaz'd upon him with ſuch an amazement, as at firſt hindered them from ſpeaking, not only by reaſon of his diſguiſe, which was ſufficient to ſurprize them, but to ſee in what a pickle he had been laid, from head to foot, which did oblige them all to hold their Noſes, no body daring to ask him the reaſon of all that, ſeeing him to be in no humour of ſatisfying their curioſity. But at laſt great ſhouts of laughter having ſucceeded all on a ſudden, to their ſurpriſal and ſilence, the Governour, who was a very civil Gentleman, did deſire his Wife and the Marchioneſs to retire, that they mght not augment his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, or rather the rage that the Marqueſs was in, and give their people occaſion to laugh at him. So he only remain'd with him, and looking on him with compaſſion, <hi>My Lord,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>what would
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:135663:211"/> you have the World to think of you? Let it think what it will; but ſtill
'tis my opinion, that it is permitted every body to mind their own buſineſs; and, if poſſibly, to prevent being betray'd: Betray'd,</hi> reply'd the Governour, <hi>and where then are theſe Traytors? Where they are!</hi> reply'd the Marqueſs in his turn, <hi>over all the Earth, and with you, more than in any place of the World. In a word, your Wife, and your Apoſtate Chaplain, who is the moſt wicked of all Traytors: But do you not ſee,</hi> reply'd the Governour, <hi>that all is but in jeſt, to make mirth; and that my Wife, and that good Father— How? a ſport to laugh at,</hi> ſaid the Marqueſs in a fury, interrupting him,
<hi>when my Honour and Life are concern'd in it? Yes, my Life, I ſay, for one cannot take the one from me without the other; when Letters are carried, and that my Wife is to be ſtoln away: But who,</hi> reply'd the Governour, <hi>who is to take her away? Who?</hi> reply'd the other, <hi>your honeſt Pilgrim, with that precious Father</hi> Andrew, <hi>through the aſſiſtance, I will not ſay of whom, for I my ſelf am aſhamed of it. Heavens! is it poſſible,</hi> ſaid the Governour, <hi>that you ſhould abuſe your ſelf in this manner? Yea, yea, I do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe my ſelf,</hi> reply'd he in a ſcornful tone, <hi>and this Hat and Peruque were not part of Father</hi> Andrew<hi>'s Equipage, who has been this night to ſpeak with my Wife through the aſſiſtance of yours: That which you now ſay, is true,</hi> reply'd the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
<hi>Father</hi> Andrew <hi>has been ſo idle as to pleaſe my Wife, in diſguiſing himſelf like a Cavalier, and ſhe made him go into the Garden to laugh at him, with the Marchioneſs; you ſhould have laugh'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and not fum'd at is as you have done: Yea, I muſt confeſs, I am mightily in the wrong,</hi> reply'd
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:135663:212"/> the Marqueſs in the ſame tone ſtill, <hi>and I was to have laugh'd at it; or rather, if you pleaſe, I ſhould have been my Wifes Confident to have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Letters which ſhe writ to the Pilgrim, and have ſaved the good Father</hi> Andrew <hi>that labour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theſe are your counſels,</hi> Monſieur <hi>the Governour, and I thank you moſt kindly for them.</hi> But — the Governour would have anſwer'd him; <hi>But,</hi> ſaid he preſently again, interrupting of him, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to leave me in quiet, and let every one govern himſelf according to his own maxims; it ſuffices that I am obliged to you, and to my Lady Governeſs, for all that could happen to me in this world of moſt cruel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While they were thus entertaining one another, the Marqueſs had rid himſelf of the Pilgrims Weeds, he immediately did run to his Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, confiding no more in <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> than in Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> and preſently he ſet his head to the Window, to ſee if the Ladder was not yet ready. The Governour, who would not leave him till he had inform'd him better, was endeavouring with the beſt reaſons that he could find, to reclaim him: <hi>Believe me,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>my dear Couſin, that Pilgrim, of whom you ſpeak, has no ſhare in this Evenings Rallery; and I am very certain, that Father</hi> Andrew, <hi>does not ſo much as know him. Good God!</hi> reply'd the Marqueſs, crying out as if poſſeſs'd, <hi>Father</hi> Andrew, <hi>that Villain, from whom I have juſt now learned all, who is carrying of a Letter from my Wife to that Pilgrim, and who is to give him notice that he need but bring a Ladder this night to get to her out at the Window, and that ſhe will follow him whereſoever he pleaſes, does not know that Traytor?</hi> All this did ſeem ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:135663:212"/> unto the Governour, and to <hi>Donna Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bara,</hi> that in lieu of adding Faith unto it, they did believe that he was crack-brain'd; and they were conſulting between them, what they ſhould do to prevent this diſtemper from growing worſe. As for the Marchioneſs, ſhe was retired into a Cloſet, ſo ſoon as ſhe had ſeen the Marqueſs come, under pretence of not expoſing her ſelf unto the rage of a jealous Mad-man; but the truth was, becauſe ſhe was ſo ſtrangely perplexed, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what had happened unto Father
<hi>Andrew,</hi> whoſe Hat and Peruque ſhe had ſeen in her Husbands Hands; above all things, fearing that ſome miſhap was come to her Letter. The Governour did think, that if he ſhould cauſe the Pilgrim to be ſecur'd, ſo that the Marqueſs ſhould have nothing further to fear from him, that that might compoſe his Brains. <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> did highly approve of this Propoſition; and her advice was, as every body thinks moſt on their own Intereſt, that it would not be amiſs to detain him Priſoner in one of the Towers of the Palace, that the Marqueſs might reſt the more ſecure; and that on the other hand, this poor Pilgrim, whom they thought not guilty, ſhould be the better treated. This being ſo concluded, it was propoſed to the Marqueſs, who was already gathering his people together, to be on the defence, in caſe of an Eſcalade, and who proteſted that there ſhould be Night and Day a Guard in his Chamber, and that his Wife ſhould not ſtir forth of it till this curſed Pilgrim were ſeis'd, and that he had ſeen him have Irons at his Feet. They promiſed him, that things ſhould be performed according to his Deſires: And the Governour ſent immediately to fetch a
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:135663:213"/> Lieutenant of the Guard, to whom he gave Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders before the Marqueſs, to inſtantly go with twelve Muſqueteers, and ſeek all about the City after an <hi>Italian</hi> Pilgrim, which he deſcribed unto him; that he ſhould not return without him but ſhould confine him in the Red Tower of the Palace. Mean time Father <hi>Andrew</hi> was come to
<hi>Camille</hi> ſo out of Breath, that he was a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time before he could ſay any thing to him, more than by Signs and Grimaces, which did as much amaze the Pilgrim, as the Equipage that he was in did make him laugh; <hi>Good God! Sir,</hi> ſaid Father <hi>Andrew</hi> to him, with his Eyes ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <hi>what hazards have I run through this day for your ſake? I have ſeen my ſelf at the laſt moment of living, and it was well for me that I had a quick eye, and a nimble foot, I had been a dead Man elſe, and kill'd, paſt all redemption, by the inraged Marqueſs his hand. Camille</hi> having enquired how, after he had taken a little Breath, he related all that had happened to him that Evening, in ſuch paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate terms, and ſuch pleaſant geſtures, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at the Adventure of the Dagger, which was doubtleſs the moſt pleaſant paſſage of all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that <hi>Camille,</hi> as vexed as he was at his gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy miſtake, whoſe evil conſequences he did very well foreſee, could not forbear laughing, ſeeing him imitate at once both the Marqueſſes and his own part, how he had lifted the Dagger up againſt him, and how he had ſhunn'd the blow, ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that his buſineſs had been done, if he had not made quick uſe both of his Eyes and Legs.
<hi>Camille,</hi> who was much more impatient to ſee the Marchioneſſes Letter, than to hear every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of that ſtory, having ask'd for it, he open'd it, and read theſe words.</p>

Let us make good uſe of time and opportunity, for I know not whether I ſhall ever have it ſo fair again; and if you can provide this very night a Ladder to get me down with from the Window, I ſhall be ready to follow you.

                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:135663:214"/>While <hi>Camille</hi> was reading this Letter with tranſports of joy and love, he did tremble on the other ſide, when he did think on the hazards that it had run of falling into the Marqueſs his Hands, which would have been the abſolute ruine of the Marchioneſs: He did ſhrewdly gueſs, though Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Andrew</hi> had not told him, that his impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had made him diſcover ſomething of the ſecret; that after ſuch a fatal Encounter there was nothing to be hoped for in their late deſign; and that the jealous Lord would certainly be upon his guard: He was diſtracted at it, which yet he durſt not wholly expreſs to the Father, for fear of putting him out of humour, perceiving very well, that which way ſoever the buſineſs ſhould go, he ſhould ſtill have occaſion for him. As they were reaſoning together on the ways they ſhould take, to know if there were any hopes of executing their Enterpriſe, without danger of being diſcover'd or known, they ſaw an Officer come into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, who, followed by ſix Muſqueteers, gave the Pilgrim to underſtand, that he had an Order from the Governour to ſecure him, and did in a civil way deſire him to ſurrender himſelf, becauſe that beſides his having of ſix Muſqueteers more at Hand, it had been expreſly commanded him to uſe him civilly; and that he ſhould be very ſorry to be obliged to uſe violent Hands. All thoſe kind expreſſions did not hinder our Heroe, who believed himſelf loſt, and who was not a Perſon to be tamely taken, to ſet himſelf in a Poſture of Defence, with a Dagger in his Hand, the only Weapon that he had then near him; ſo that mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre their great number, he ſold them his liberty at a dear rate, having wounded three or four of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:135663:214"/> the Souldiers; who having ſpared him at firſt, were at laſt ſo netled at the ſight of their blood, that they were making at him, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regard unto the Governours Orders of favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who had never been in ſuch a Fray, whether being animated thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the example of the Pilgrims generous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, or that the Cavaliers dreſs he was in, of which he had loſt nothing but the Hat and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruque, did infuſe courage in him; he plaid the Devil amongſt them; and did ſo well ſecond the Valiant <hi>Camille,</hi> that the Lieutenant had occaſion for the other ſix Souldiers, which he call'd to his aſſiſtance. They were forc'd at laſt to yield to the greater number: Father <hi>Andrew</hi> was the firſt taken, and the moſt ill treated, having not been ſpared, as had been the Pilgrim; there had rain'd upon his back and head, which was naked, a whole deluge of blows of Garabines, and flats of Swords; he crying out as one that was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently beaten;
<hi>Ah! you Villains, is it thus that you treat poor Father</hi> Andrew, <hi>the Governours Chaplain, and Religious Prieſt of the Order of S.</hi> Dominick? <hi>Ye are all Excommunicated, and I Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you for ever if you do not hold.</hi> At the name of Father
<hi>Andrew,</hi> rather than at the noiſe of the Excommunication, there was a Truce of blows; and at the ſame time the Pilgrim ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſeiſed, they were both had to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, though there was Order but for <hi>Camille,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the reſiſtance that Father
<hi>Andrew</hi> had made, upon whom the Souldiers had been more ſevere, as it did very well appear, they having diſcharged the greateſt part of their anger upon him, ſo that he could but difficultly move. He
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:135663:215"/> was thus very well rewarded for all his Meſſages: Fortune does not always favour us in all Places; and her ordinary viciſſitudes are in making croſs Events to ſucceed the faireſt beginnings.</p>
                  <p>The Pilgrim was lodged in the Red Tower, and his Companion was had before the Governour, to know what ſhould be done with him. Father <hi>Andrew</hi> would have willingly redeemed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from ſo ſhameful a Scene, with the hundred Piſtols which he had received: And for certain, how great ſoever the Governours ſurpriſe was to ſee him in ſo ſtrange a dreſs, and to lean that he was found with the Pilgrim, he could not forbear laughing, in ſpight of the ſerious countenance which he had took upon him, to ſee him in ſo ſad a pickle with that new garment, which had been extremely diſordered in the Battle. <hi>Donna Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bara,</hi> who was gone to Bed, and could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her ſelf that it was her Ghoſtly Father, did riſe to ſee him, and was yet more ſupris'd than had been the Governour, but did not laugh, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a greater intereſt in it than her Husband, not doubting after this, but that all which the Marqueſs had ſaid concerning the Intrigues between the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs and the Pilgrim were real truths. All her anger was preſently turn'd againſt Father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,</hi> not only for his ſerving her Rival, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had made her a party, having caus'd her to act a part very unworthy of her, and moſt cruel to her Heart. She took no notice of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her Husband, but was reſolv'd to treat him the next morning as he deſerv'd. The Governour, who thought the Fryer had been ſufficiently pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for all his follies, caus'd him to be releas'd, and preſently ſent Word to the Marqueſs, that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:135663:215"/> the Pilgrim was ſecur'd: This was a great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to him: yet he did not ſleep the better for it, but had all night long Viſions of Palmer Staves, Hats with Shells, and ſuch like things, againſt which his Mind could not yet be well ſetled, though the cauſe of all thoſe Terrours of his was in Priſon.</p>
                  <p>The unfortunate <hi>Camille,</hi> overwhelm'd with Vexations and Deſpair in that Priſon, was much troubled about the Cauſe that ſhould move the Governour to have him thus apprehended in the Night-time, and after ſuch Kindneſſes which he had ſhew'd him: the time which he had allow'd him in <hi>Barcelona</hi> was not yet expired, and on the Marqueſs his account he did not believe there was any reaſon to uſe that extremity towards him; and it was much more probable, as he could not doubt it, that the Governour had dived into his Wife's Folly; and that the ſame Reaſons which oblig'd him to forbid him the Court, and not to remain above three Days in the City, had incited him alſo to caſt him into Priſon. Theſe Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations made him exclaim againſt his too rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Fate, that thus did load him with Troubles, through the Love of a Woman whom he could not fancy, when he was juſt upon the point of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt happy of all Men with her that he adored. This Thought, with the little Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation he had for the Governour's Wife, did not not a little contribute to make him abſolutely hate her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> had not that Night her Mind leſs fill'd with Sorrow and Care for her Lover: She had ſcarce ſeen him, but ſhe had lov'd him with ſo violent a Paſſion, which did every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:135663:216"/> encreaſe, and the ſole Idea of that Pilgrim did ſo tranſport her, that there was not any thing which ſhe would not perform to gain his Affections. Mean time ſhe learns that he loves another, and concludes that the Repulſes, or at leaſt the Indifferency that he had ſhewn to her the Night before, did all proceed from thence; and that when he came to her, it was with an Intention to have met with the Marchioneſs, as it had afterwards appear'd by his Surprize. Theſe were cruel Reflections for a Woman that loves with ſuch a Paſſion as ſhe did the Pilgrim, and yet they were not powerful enough to cure her; and in the midſt of all the Sorrow ſhe had, to find her Affections run ſo far in favour of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Perſon, which would triumph over them before her Rival, ſhe did ſigh and earneſtly wiſh that Day were come, that ſhe might find out ſome way of ſeeing him. Father <hi>Andrew</hi> was now the only Object of her Anger, as if he had been the Cauſe of all her Misfortunes: She wiſh'd that he would gueſs the Concerns which ſhe had for the Pilgrim; and that in lieu of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him towards the Marchioneſs, he would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to her all that which had paſſed between thoſe two Lovers, that ſhe might break all their Meaſures; that is, ſhe deſired that which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. This is commonly the odd Compoſure of Mind of ſuch Perſons as are poſſeſs'd with ſo violent a Paſſion: Mean time ſhe was preparing very ſevere Mortifications for the good Father, the leaſt of which was to ſend him back to his Monaſtery.</p>
                  <p>The Morning, which affords Counſel on the things which have been concluded in the Night,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:135663:216"/> and frequently with Advantage, did cauſe the Governeſs to go quite another way to work than what ſhe had deſigned: She ſent to ſeek after Father Father
<hi>Andrew</hi> ſo ſoon as ſhe was up; but the good Father who had not reſted well that Night, though not tormented with Love as ſhe had been, was yet in Bed, and caus'd his Excuſes to be made to Madam the Governeſs, that thro' ſome Defluxions which had that Night troubled him, and from which he was not yet quite free, he could not come ſo ſoon to wait upon her.
<hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Barbara,</hi> to whom Love would afford no reſt, being impatient to ſee and ſpeak with the Father, went her ſelf unto his Chamber, under the Veil of an Act of Charity, and to learn what was her Father Confeſſor's Diſtemper: Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who expected not this Honour, was much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd at the ſight of her; and after ſome Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions which ſhe made him on the Condition of his Diſtemper, the true Cauſe of which he would never tell her, the Lady taking upon her a more ſerious Air, began to make him a Fraternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrancy, that with ſo little regard to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious <hi>Decorum,</hi> he was become the Confident of a mean Pilgrim, and had made her alſo inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in the Intrigue, and the Fop of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that would take no ſmall advantage of it; adding, that the Governour had reſented it very much, and would have ſent him back to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, had ſhe not oppos'd it, and endeavour'd to excuſe him. Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> moſt humble and contrite, at thoſe Leſſons which <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> made him, did return her Thanks for all the good Offices which ſhe had rendred him towards the Governour, proteſting that he had not acted any
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:135663:217"/> thing in all that, but what was in pure Zeal of ſerving his Neighbour, not imagining there was any evil in it, that otherwiſe for certain he had not done it; and that for his part, he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die, than entertain the leaſt Thought of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing her. The paſſionate Lady, who deſign'd to make her advantage from the Fathers Faults, would not be ſatisfied with his excuſes, ſeeming very unwilling to pardon him without he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to gain her Favour by ſome other means: She would firſt learn from him all that had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between thoſe two Lovers; the Father, who had not enter'd very far into <hi>Camille</hi>'s concerns, did endeavour to ſatisfie her as well as he could, in giving her a ſincere and faithful Account of that little which he knew of their Amours. But ſhe was not ſatisfied with that neither; and ſhe made him divers other queſtions, to which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd according to his
<hi>Memoirs,</hi> which did not extend very far. <hi>You do not believe then,</hi> ſaid the Governeſs to him, after ſhe had been ſome time ſilent, <hi>that it is long ſince this Pilgrim has been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Marchioneſs, nor that he is much in love with her? As to Love, Madam,</hi> anſwer'd he, not knowing what intereſt the Lady had in all theſe enquiries,
<hi>I cannot ſay but that he does very much love her, but I know that their acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is but new; that they have ſcarce had one opportunity to diſcourſe one another; and finally, that all their intelligence has yet gone no further than to a deſign of delivering the Marchioneſs out of her Husbands tyrannical jealouſie. Donna Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bara</hi> took a little courage at Father
<hi>Andrew</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and as an unreſolved Perſon, who had a thouſand deſigns in her Head that perplexed her,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:135663:217"/> frequently beginning divers diſcourſes, and ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breaking them off, without finiſhing of any, ſhe at laſt told him, that ſhe was concern'd for that young Man, whom the Marqueſs was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to ruine; and that the Governour would hardly have power to ſave him. Father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,</hi> who had a real affection for the Pilgrim, was much concern'd at the News, and began to intercede for him to <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> telling her, that he was the moſt honeſt, civil, and generous Pilgrim in the whole World, that it were a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pityes to take away his life, and that his death would draw ſome miſchief upon her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, becauſe it had never heard, that any Man that had once Vowed himſelf to S.
<hi>Jago,</hi> had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been hang'd. <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> being ſomewhat perſwaded with the good Fathers reaſons, did promiſe to concern her ſelf further for him, but yet that ſhe would have the Pilgrim to intreat her to it himſelf, that he might know to whom he were obliged; ſo that ſhe would have him go to the Pilgrim, and give him an account of his affairs. That he ſhould be ſure to repreſent the danger he was yet in greater than it was, and that he ſhould inſenſibly give him to underſtand, that there was no Perſon, but ſhe that could ſave him.</p>
                  <p>Father <hi>Andrew</hi> having been further inſtructed in all things, and yet not able to dive into the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, was very well pleaſed however to ſee her ſo well diſpoſed to ſerve his dear Pilgrim, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well what power ſhe had over the Governours Spirit, he return'd her thanks before hand for the kindneſs that ſhe ſhew'd in the behalf of a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, who ſhe would find, when ſhe ſhould know
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:135663:218"/> him, worthy of her care. <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> who valued not his Complement, did preſs him to make haſte, telling him, that ſhe would ſtay for his Anſwer in her Chamber; and he promiſed her to be within a moment at the Priſon: There he found the Pilgrim much dejected and caſt down, and imbracing him with a great tenderneſs; <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Sir,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I hope that you ſhall not die: That I ſhall not die,</hi> ſaid
<hi>Camille, am I then ſo near being condemn'd? No, but I fear,</hi> reply'd Father <hi>Andrew, that you may be ſo if you have not ſome Body to ſollicite for you; for the Marqueſs does not only accuſe you of having endeavour'd for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly to take away his Wife from him, but that you would have murdered him alſo: And what proof is there of all this?</hi> reply'd <hi>Camille. I know not,</hi> ſaid the Father, <hi>but I believe that you will be condemned, whatever the proofs may be, if you do not apply your ſelf to the protection of ſome Perſon of ſufficient power to ſave you. Camille,</hi> who pittied him to hear him reaſon ſo ſimply, did only tell him, that if he had no body but the Marqueſs to fear, he did not believe that he ſtood in want of any Perſons protection. Father <hi>Andrew</hi> having once again endeavour'd to repreſent the danger greater to him than he did imagine it, the Pilgrim ask'd him, <hi>Where he had learn'd all that:</hi> To which he anſwer'd, <hi>From a Lady that had a great power at Court, and good intentions towards him: In a Word, that he had it from the Governours Lady. From the Governours Lady!</hi> replyed <hi>Camille; well Father, I have ſo little inclination to be her Debtor, that I had rather die than be obliged to her for my life: And carry her back that anſwer,</hi> continued he, <hi>if it is ſhe that has ſent you here on
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:135663:218"/> that Errand; tell her beſide, that death will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come ſo ſoon as I deſire it.</hi> Father <hi>Andrew</hi> aſtoniſhed at this high Spirit, did endeavour to reclaim him a little, and enquir'd of him, what reaſon he had to refuſe, in the ſad condition he was, ſuch marks of affection, as would have fill'd with honour and joy any other Perſon than he? <hi>I have nothing further to ſay to you on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and peradventure I have more cauſe of complaint of the Governour's Wife, than of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her thanks; But that is not the buſineſs: Go back to her, Father, and tell her, that if I muſt die, I am reſolv'd, but no lowneſs on my part.</hi> Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who had not comprehended any thing of the Governeſſes deſign, could yet leſs unravel what reaſons the Pilgrim had to ſlight ſo much her obliging offers, as to chuſe to die, rather than ſo much as entreat her. He could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that there was any particular acquaintance between them; and yet he did believe, that the odd way, after which they both acted, was not without ſome kind of Myſtery, which did ſpeak ſomething more, than from ſuch Perſons as did not know one another. His Brains not diving fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into this myſtery, he left no time to unravel all that Intrigue, and return'd unto <hi>Donna Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> to whom he gave an account of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which ſhe had given him; and if he did not relate to her wholly with what ſcorn the Pilgrim had receiv'd the offers of her protection, he how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever told her enough to make her underſtand the ſmall eſteem he had of her: <hi>What? he will die then,</hi> ſaid ſhe,
<hi>with an Emotion which ſhe had much to do to conceal: Yes, Madam,</hi> reply'd the Father,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:135663:219"/> 
                     <hi>rather than be obliged to any one for his life: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, Madam, becauſe he does not believe that he deſerves death: Ah! cruel!</hi> ſhe then cry'd out, not being able to ſuppreſs her ſighs any longer, <hi>it is not that which makes him anſwer after this manner, but the extream paſſion which he has for the Marchioneſs, and the averſion which he feels for all other Women: It is not with you, Father, that I muſt conſtrain my ſelf any longer,</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe bluſhing; <hi>and ſeeing that you already know all the weakneſſes of my Soul, therefore it would be uſeleſs to conceal this from you: This Pilgrim has ſome ſecret Art to Charm Women with: Since the firſt day that I ſaw him, and that he caſt his eyes on me, I have felt for him ſuch things as are not naturally felt for ordinary Perſons; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I have oppos'd againſt it, to remove him from my mind, I have been daily more and more poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with it; I know that I do ill, but I have no power to reſiſt him, and find that the more my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould be oppoſed, the more it would break forth: I will try what time can do; mean time, Father, if you have any conſideration for me, you will have pity of the condition I am in, and will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to qualifie in ſome meaſure the torment that I endure, for none can do it better than you.</hi> Father <hi>Andrew</hi> overjoy'd at this her confiding in him, which gave him ſo fair a return upon <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Barbara,</hi> did make her alſo a gentle and ſhort Remonſtrancy, as in Duty bound, and did repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to her the conſequences of thoſe kind of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, the ſorrow that they are commonly accompanied with, and the publick ſhame when once they broke forth: all this was deliver'd very mildly, and ſtill with ſtore of Howevers, which
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:135663:219"/> did ſweeten the bitterneſs of the Remonſtrancy, which was none of the ſevereſt. And at laſt find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there was no hopes of diſwading her that way, (neither had he much mind to do it) he ſhifted into another diſcourſe, as an Indulgent Director ſhould do, and told her in a languiſhing and devout tone, That ſeeing the Spiritual Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies had no power over her, ſhe was to make uſe of thoſe that were Natural, and of two Evils ſhun the worſt, which was the ſcandal, in which ſhe muſt of neceſſity have fallen, if the Heavens had not inſpired her to addreſs her ſelf to a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo diſcreet as he was, ſhe knowing what zeal he had for her Service. <hi>Do but repoſe your ſelf on my cares, Madam,</hi> continued he, <hi>and ſince that the chiefeſt buſineſs is to make you to be beloved, know that I have ſome ſecrets as powerful in that point as are the Pilgrims; and that before he ſleeps, he ſhall ſigh for you.</hi> That laſt word made <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> ſigh, who languiſhingly looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Father Conſolator; <hi>How much you promiſe me in a ſhort time, Father,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>to do this, he muſt firſt forget an Object with which he is too much poſſeſt, and for which he hath doubtleſs left his Country, and be mov'd with the like thought for me: So great a change,</hi> continued ſhe, <hi>is not done in one Day: No, no! do but make him loſe all hopes of ever ſeeing the Marchioneſs, and in the preſſing danger of his Life, as you may repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it to him, make him ſee how much better it would be for him to turn his affections towards me; for he already knows I love him, and that it is his own fault if he is not happy.</hi> Father <hi>Andrew</hi> having been ſufficiently inſtructed in all things, to acquit himſelf of that Imploy, as a zealous
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:135663:220"/> and expert Truſtee, he promiſed <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> not to forget any thing: And ſo parting each with his particular Idea's, they both went to labour to bring about their deſign.</p>
                  <p>The Marqueſs and the Marchioneſs had paſs'd the Night as a Husband and Wife could do, when they are of ſo bad Intelligence as thoſe two were. The Governour had engaged the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Marqueſs, before they had parted, to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to his Requeſt all the Reſentments that he might have againſt his Wife; and had had a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe from the Marchioneſs, never to have any Deſign againſt her Husbands Honour and Intereſts. Thus a certain kind of Reconciliation having been made upon this, he had left them both in a paſſable good Reſolution of living Friendly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. All this was good in the outward Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but the inward Parts are not ſo ſoon cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and as the Marqueſs could but very hardly forgive his Wife the treaſonable Trick ſhe would have plaid him, his Wife did not deſpair of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out ſome other Pilgrims, if this ſhould fail her. Here were two Perſons very ſtrangely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention'd, and that might lie long enough toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet have no true Peace between them. Neither was there any thing elſe all Night, but Maundrings on the Husband's ſide, and Sighs on that of the Wife, which laſted till Morning. A pitiful Society! A ſad Alliance, which is but too often met withal in this wicked Age! It is not without Cauſe therefore, that the Mode of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marrying has been found out of late.</p>
                  <p>The Governour's Wife, who was impatient to ſpeak with the Marqueſs, had order'd a Page to wait all the Morning at his Chamber-door, to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:135663:220"/> tell him, when he was up, that ſhe had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to impart to him. It was very late before he came to her, with a ſad and melancholy Countenance, partly through the ill Night which he had paſſed, and the little reaſon that he had to be ſatisfied with
<hi>Donna Barbara</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; as for her part, expecting no better, ſhe was not ſurpriz'd at it, and without further minding of it, ſhe told him, that ſhe knew the Cauſe, which he thought he had to be angry with her, but that ſhe proteſted to him, that ſhe did not know any thing of Father <hi>Andrew</hi>'s late Deſign, in which her Honour had not been as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd as his, ſhe not being of Quality nor Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to ſerve any one in ſuch amorous Intrigues; that ſhe did not only intend to have that inſolent Monk puniſh'd for it, but that ſhe expected that the Marchioneſs ſhould alſo make her ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment thereupon; and driving her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments further yet, ſhe added, That it was a thing very unworthy a Perſon of Quality, that had marry'd a Marqueſs, who had been honour'd with ſo many brave Employs, and deſcended of one of the prime Families of that Kingdom, to abandon her ſelf in that manner to the Love of a Pilgrim, of a Beggar, which ſhe had rather fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low than her own Husband. Finally, ſhe ſet her ſelf up in ſo fine a Mode of Invectives, that the Marqueſs, who did believe her to be angry in earneſt, had much to do to appeaſe her. He did ask her a thouſand times Pardon for his Wife, acknowledging that ſhe did not deſerve to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd to a Perſon of ſuch Honour and Quality as ſhe was; that it was his Misfortune, and he the more to be pitied: The Concluſion of all this
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:135663:221"/> was, That <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> did adviſe the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs to convey his Wife to ſome ſolitary place, and learn her to be wiſe: But the Marqueſs, who was tainted with that Weakneſs incident to all Jealous Husbands, that cannot part with their Wives, though never ſo many Reaſons to incite them to it, was not at firſt of her Opinion, and thought it more reaſonable to remove the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Cauſe of all thoſe Diſorders, the Pilgrim, which the Governour could do no leſs than ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him out of the Kingdom, if he would not condemn him to die; as ſuch Attempts, as that wicked Perſons were, did deſerve. <hi>Donna Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bara,</hi> who was concern'd in all this, did as little approve of the Marqueſs's Deſigns, ſhewing him, that beſides thoſe Forms that were to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in doing Juſtice, which would not permit the Governour to baniſh a Man without being firſt examined, it were more proper to leave him for ſome time in Priſon, to puniſh him for his Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency; and that there were beſides certain Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as to the Decency and Policy of the buſineſs, which required ſome other kind of Uſage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that this Baniſhment would ſeem leſs Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, than a Pretence, whereby to be rid of a Perſon which he feared, and of whom he were jealous; and that however it would be an eaſie matter for this Pilgrim to go into the Kingdom of <hi>Valencia,</hi> or in that of <hi>Aragon,</hi> and there cauſe him the ſame Troubles, as he had done in
<hi>Catalonia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Marqueſs, who was not one of the beſt Head-pieces in the World, was yielding to
<hi>Donna Barbara</hi>'s Reaſons; who added this beſides, that when the Marchioneſs ſhould be inform'd of the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:135663:221"/> Pilgrim's Liberty, ſhe would not deſpair to ſee him again, and that the ſureſt way to cure her of that Fancy, was to take from her all poſſible Hopes of ever ſeeing him more, by removing her from him ſo ſoon as poſſible he could, ſo that ſhe might never more hear him mentioned. The Marqueſs being now wholly convinced, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to be gone the very next Day, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to it, he went to ſeek the Governour, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him of his reſolution, who did endeavour to diſſwade him from it, but all in vain, for he did not confide much in him neither, by reaſon of his Indulgency towards the Pilgrim.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> was of opinion, that ſhe had very much advanced her buſineſs, in having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded this jealous Man to leave <hi>Barcelona,</hi> flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering her ſelf with the thoughts that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs, whom ſhe did look upon as the ſole Obſtacle to her deſires, being once diſtanced from her Lover, ſhe would find it no longer ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be belov'd by him. To wholly deceive her in that Opinion, there needed no more but Father
<hi>Andrew,</hi> who after he had but very fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly diſcourſed the Pilgrim on theſe Inſtructions, that the Lady had given him, would not quite put her into deſpair, in informing her of the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle eſteem that this Lover had for her; for then he would himſelf have loſt thoſe advantages which he did hope to gain by his cares, as alſo the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of continuing longer in the Office of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſſes Confident. He therefore gave her hopes that the Pilgrim would not always prove inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble towards her, that he had found him much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſince thoſe fine things which he had told him concerning her, and that if ſhe would be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:135663:222"/> but a little, ſhe ſhould find him, if not quite ſo paſſionate as ſhe deſerved, yet at the leaſt very penitent for having ſlighted her favours, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſoftned to give her ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>As there is nothing that more eaſily makes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in our Minds than thoſe things which pleaſe us, and which we deſire, Father <hi>Andrew</hi> did not ſay one Word to that Paſſionate Lady which did not give her infinite content, though under doubtful appearances; the good Father, who did diſcern it in her Eyes, did continually add ſome new thing unto the amorous Narrative. So that <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> being impatient to ſee the effects of Father
<hi>Andrew</hi>'s rare ſecrets, did reſolve to go in a Diſguiſe to the Priſon, to be a Witneſs unto their Diſcourſes, and to reliſh the whole Pleaſure of them.</p>
                  <p>This propoſition did ſtartle the Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, well knowing that ſhe ſhould hear nothing there, but what would be contrary to thoſe hopes which he had given her. He oppos'd himſelf as much as he could to that Deſign, ſetting before her the evident danger unto which ſhe ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her ſelf; which beſides would not have a good effect on the Pilgrim's Mind, of which ſhe was to manage well the value, if ſhe would be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd of him in good earneſt; but all thoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and many more which he told her to draw himſelf out of the Bryars, were not of force to remove her from that deſign. They were of no value with a Woman, whoſe Soul was fill'd with fiery tranſports. <hi>Father, I know,</hi> ſaid ſhe, not giving ear to half what he ſaid, <hi>all that you can ſay to me, and I ſhould know what I had to do in this Caſe, if, in the condition I am, I were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:135663:222"/> of ſome Reflections or Reaſons. But when one loves, as I do, nothing but the deſires of the Heart are hearkned unto; and it would be fruitleſs to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the diſſwading me from it; for I can follow no other Counſel; and without any further reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the caſe, ſince it is my buſineſs, and that you are willing to ſerve me in it, I deſire you to get me in readineſs againſt Night, one of your No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices Garments, and not to trouble your ſelf any farther in the buſineſs, for though I ſhould but ſee this Pilgrim, I ſhall be extremely recompenſed for the pains I ſhall have taken.</hi> Father
<hi>Andrew</hi> ſeeing that there was no hopes of making her change her reſolution, did promiſe to perform whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhe ſhould deſire, though he foreſaw the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that there was for them both in it. But <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars</hi> in all buſineſſes have always a back door o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to get out at. He went to his Convent, where he ſoon fitted himſelf with a Novices Habit, about the Ladies ſtature, which he had conveyed into the Palace. When the hour was come,
<hi>Donna Barbara</hi> fail'd not to go to his Chamber, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare her ſelf for the Maſquerade, with as much earneſtneſs as Father <hi>Andrew</hi> was backwards; but he was forc'd to reſolve upon it, and for that time to officiate to the Lady, who was not very well acquainted with that <hi>Jacobin</hi> Equipage in the Place of a <hi>Valet de Chambre;</hi> during his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy he had here and there ſome little pleaſures, and his new Office, giving him ſomewhat more of Liberty than that of a Spiritual Director would afford him, he made good uſe of it; for it is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary with <hi>Monks</hi> to make an advantage of all things, and this, who was a moſt perfect one, did make pretty good uſe of his Rights, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:135663:223"/> that Gown and Frock on the <hi>Sennora Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> of whom he made the prittyeſt little <hi>Friar</hi> that ever was in the <hi>Novitiat;</hi> if all this was without Temptaion I ſhall not tell. Finally, all being ready, they went out of the Chamber, and marched on without noiſe or light towards the red Tower, and with ſo good fortune as to meet with no Perſon in the Palace that did ſpeak to them. <hi>Camille</hi>'s reſtraint being not ſo extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrict, Father <hi>Andrew</hi> had leave, through <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Barbara</hi>'s Order, to ſee him at what hour he pleas'd; ſo that it was not difficult for them to get in; they found the Pilgrim lying on his Bed, reading in a Book, a kind of Conſolation in his Afflictions.
<hi>Well, Father,</hi> ſaid he to the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, ſo ſoon as he ſaw him appear,
<hi>have you no better News for me, than thoſe which you have brought me hitherto? and ſhall I have Juſtice done me, or muſt I dye in this Priſon? I have already told you, Sir,</hi> reply'd he, making him ſign that there was a Novice after him, of whom they ſhould be wary,
<hi>it lies in you to go out of it, and to be the happieſt of all Men. Happy! After what manner?</hi> (replyed <hi>Camille,</hi> who thought there was no great danger in ſpeaking before a young Brother) <hi>in imploring the aſſiſtance of a Perſon that is peradventure the ſole cauſe of all my Evil? Of a Woman—Yea! but of ſuch a Woman,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted the Father, ſtill making ſign, <hi>that has a great eſteem and affection for you, that knows your worth, and that doubtleſs deſerves that you ſhould conſider her not as your Enemy, or the cauſe of your misfortune, towards which ſhe has never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed, but as a Lady that concerns her ſelf in your affairs, and that would inform you what an
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:135663:223"/> intereſt ſhe has in them. I know more on that ſubject, Father,</hi> reply'd the Pilgrim, who did not comprehend to what purpoſe thoſe ſigns were made, <hi>than you can tell me, and in a word, if you would oblige me, never ſpeak more of her to me.</hi> To which Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who was in a violent ſweat to hear him ſpeak in that manner, reply'd, <hi>But this Morning, Sir, you were not in this Mind, and I found you in my Opinion, more full of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments towards a Perſon, that you cannot hate without ingratitude. You deceive you ſelf, Father,</hi> reply'd <hi>Camille,</hi> who was wondring at the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Diſcourſe, as much as at his ſigns, <hi>I am no Changling, and what I tell you now, I did both think and ſay in the Morning; you know that I love, and tho' my Heart ſhould be capable of Perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs, it</hi>—there he made a ſtop, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the little Novice, that was drawn nearer them, did look ſtedfaſtly in his Face, with a Countenance that did amaze him.
<hi>Go on thou cruel one,</hi> ſaid the little Brother to him, <hi>and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that I ſhould deſerve nothing, though I ſhould act all that can be imagined for thee. Camille,</hi> who would never have known <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a Dreſs, did fall into the greateſt amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the World, when he heard her voice. He could ſcarce believe his own Eyes, examining her from Head to Foot. <hi>Yes, look,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>and ſee what Love makes me do for thee, maugre all thy ſcorns? what I have done hitherto is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, but I come now to conclude my ruin for the moſt ungrateful of all Men. Alas, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> reply'd <hi>Camille, it is me that you ruin, and that you render miſerable. How miſerable? ſpeak,</hi> reply'd ſhe, <hi>canſt thou complain but of being too
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:135663:224"/> much beloved? is there any Perſon of worth in the World that would ſay ſo much of the meaneſt of Women? thou troubleſt thy ſelf about my cares, thou thinkeſt that it would be a ſhame to thee to be obliged to me for thy life, and preferreſt thy Priſon to Liberty, only becauſe that it is offer'd thee by me.</hi> The paſſionate and winning manner that the amorous <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> did uſe in her reproaches to her Pilgrim, certainly there was no Heart but what would be ſomewhat mov'd at it, and <hi>Camille,</hi> whoſe Heart was not wholly inſenſible, was touch'd with compaſſion, and did endeavour to excuſe himſelf, on the reſpect which he owed to the Governour, to whom he would not for the World, have given ſo great a cauſe of complaint, after the great Civilities which he had received from him.
<q rend="inline">The Governour? (replyed <hi>Donna Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>) pitiful conſiderations, and ſeeing that I paſs them by, thou ſhouldſt not ſcruple to do the ſame: But rather ſay, and never ſeek after ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretences, that to my grief thou cam'ſt into theſe parts, with a Heart fill'd with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Object: That it is the Marchioneſs that renders uſeleſs, and even odious to thee, all my Cares, my Kindneſſes, and all things elſe, that I would do for thee. When thou doſt own it to me, I ſhall do thy Heart juſtice; but then add to it, that I might have been agreeable to thee, if thou hadſt ſeen me firſt; and that when ever thou ſhalt looſe all hopes of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her, thou wilt remember with what a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I love thee, and give thy ſelf wholly to me. Other Women would not be contented with this ſmall requeſt; there are but few that would love thee at that rate: But I will make
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:135663:224"/> thee ſenſible, how far the exceſs of a real Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will extend.
<hi>Camille,</hi> had never found himſelf in ſo great a confuſion:</q> He could not refuſe ſome complaiſances, at leaſt, to a Lady ſo tranſported with Love, as ſhe was for him; and he had need to qualifie his diſdain, to give her ſome anſwer ſuitable to her paſſionate Diſcourſes; yet nothing did more contribute to thoſe kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes which he expreſſed to her, as the deſire which he had to be rid of her, inceſſantly fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhe ſhould be ſupriz'd with him in that diſguiſe, and that this viſit ſhould come to the Governour's knowledge, which would make an end of ruining him, he could not forbear expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his ſenſe of it to the Lady, intreating her to have patience, till he had recover'd his liberty, and that then there would be leſs danger for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, and they might have the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſeeing one another the longer. But ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incapable of any reaſon, did reproach him all his fears; which ſhe, being wholly taken up with her paſſion, could not entertain. Yet at laſt to let him ſee that ſhe did love him to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, as to deprive her ſelf of what was moſt pleaſing to her, which was to ſee him, ſhe left him, and at her going, ſhe did force from him ſome kindneſſes, which either real, or fictitious, did however extreamly conſolate her.</p>
                  <p>Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who had ſeen this viſit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded far better than he expected, did receive by it, almoſt as much of ſatisfaction as <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> had, and did much glory in it, and did congratulate her of her happy Succeſs; to which he thought he had not a little contributed. They both went out of the <hi>Tower,</hi> entertaining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:135663:225"/> with the merits and fine Qualities of this Pilgrim, which were thought to be ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ones, that ſhe would needs have him to be ſome Prince in a diſguiſe; ſeeing nothing but what was great and extraordinary in all his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The good Father, who knew how much it would pleaſe her to extend himſelf upon the Pilgrim's praiſes, did ever out-do her at that ſport, and the earneſtneſs they were both in, did ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport them, that without conſidering they were in the Enemies Territories, they did ſpeak ſo loud, that any body might hear them: So that being come near to ſome ſteps, which were to be acſended,
<hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> who knew not ſo well the way in the dark, as Father <hi>Andrew</hi> did, did bid him lend her his Hand to help her up the ſteps. The Father, who went firſt, turn'd back; but when he would have taken her by the hand, he found it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſeiz'd on, and that ſomebody elſe did do her that Office. Upon this, ſuch a fear did ſeize on him, as it would have done on many others; that without ſpeaking one word, he ſtole away into his Chamber, as faſt, and with as little noiſe, as he could: Where I believe he Barricadoed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up, and, I believe, had but an ill Night of it. <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> hearing ſome body walk ſo near them, did ſoftly ask of the Father, who ſhe thought ſhe had by the hand, what that was. But this Father would make no anſwer, it being the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, who returning from giving the laſt orders for his departure, was waiting there for his Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beau, that was blown out, and which was gone, to be lighted again. <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> preſaging no good from that ſilence, did inquire of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Father the reaſon of it; and was thinking
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:135663:225"/> to retire, fearing ſome ſurpriſal, juſt as the Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beau appear'd; by whoſe light having perceiv'd, that it was not Father <hi>Andrew</hi> that did hold her by the hand, ſhe made a great out-cry, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently got away, leaving one of her Gloves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind her, not having had time to diſcern who it was. But ſhe was perfeectly known by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, who had had leaſure to hear her diſcourſe with Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> which gave no ſmall cauſe of reflection to our Jealous, who ſince the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had thought her the moſt virtuous Wife in all <hi>Spain:</hi> And the Governour the happieſt of all Men, becauſe he could take his reſt in quiet. The Dreſs ſhe was in, did ſurprize him more than all the reſt, he who was a profeſſed Bigot, and who did perceive to what uſe were put ſuch holy things. He concluded, that Father <hi>Andrew</hi> muſt of neceſſity be made one in all thoſe ſports, on whom he did already look as on one of <hi>Lucifer</hi>'s black Inſtruments, ſent into the World to corrupt all Woman-kind. He could eaſily gueſs, by what he had heard them ſay, that they were newly come from viſiting the Pilgrim; and that thought did ſomewhat comfort him; for in this World there's nothing like having Companions in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, which makes them not ſeem ſo weighty to us. He had a great itching immediately to give the Governour an account of this Adventure; but becauſe he knew him to be extreamly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt with a good opinion of his Wife, and that he ſhould have to do with a bold and high ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited Lady, he feared that a Glove might not be ſufficient proof, wherewith to perſwade the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, that he was in his predicament, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Lady of being concern'd in a gallant
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:135663:226"/> Intrigue. And that conſequently he ſhould but cauſe ſome diſorder, and draw upon himſelf all the evil of that Intrigue. So that he took the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of being ſilent, and return'd to his own A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, reflecting often within himſelf, how little Women were to be truſted, and that ſome did make Horns to others, who had his own Houſe full of them. Upon this he careſſed his Wife with a better heart than he had done in a long time; and as he knew that nothing could work a greater effect on the minds of Female kind, than Jealouſie would, he could not forbear giving her an account of the pleaſant Rencounter which he had had. The Marchioneſs would have had much to do to have believed it, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſome effect of his jealous mind, to make her hate the Pilgrim, if he had not aſſur'd her, that he had ſeen them both come out of the <hi>Tower;</hi> if he had not repeated to her the ſame Diſcourſes, which had paſs'd between Father <hi>Andrew</hi> and the Lady, and finally if he had not ſhown her the Ladies own Glove, which had been left in his hands. Of truth, after that laſt proof ſhe had no more to ſay, and the ſincerity with which ſhe ſee him ſpeak to her, knowing him perfectly well, did make as great an impreſſion in her mind as all the reſt did; ſo that ſhe began to feel within her ſelf more hatred for that perfidious Man, and more Jealouſie againſt her Rival, than ſhe could have thought to have had upon ſo ſlender a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. The Marqueſs, who, though his Wife was ſilent, did eaſily ſee in her Eyes, and perceive by her very ſilence, that he had compaſſed his ends, and animated her with almoſt as much Hatred againſt <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> as he had been againſt his
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:135663:226"/> Wife: He further did inform her, how excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently that fair Lady had acted the Virtuous Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans part with him that Morning, having flown very high againſt her Conduct, even to the giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſuch Counſels as he would not follow; which confirm'd the Marchioneſſes rage againſt them both, though he would not let her know what thoſe Advices were: So that what with Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, and what with Reſentments, ſhe was all Night in little kind of rages, which would let her take but very little reſt, wiſhing with great impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiency for day, that ſhe might be gone, having no other deſires left, than to remove from a place, where ſhe could be of no other uſe than a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty to her Rival, to whom that Traytor the Pilgrim had doubtleſs diſcovered all their ſecret Intrigue.</p>
                  <p>The Marqueſs who had not changed his deſign, though he had found out, that another had as well as his Wife a Months mind to the Pilgrim, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well, that in all thoſe kind of things, others Examples do rather authorize than deter, was the firſt riſing in the Palace, to have all his Retinue in a readineſs to march, and continue his Voyage towards <hi>Madrid,</hi> where he was going. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and his Lady did riſe alſo to wait upon them out of Town; but the firſt thing that <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Barbara</hi> did, ſo ſoon as her Husband went out of the Chamber, was to ſend after Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> to enquire of him who that Man was that affrighted the Father, who was poſſeſs'd with the ſame curioſity, having ſpent all the Night in a ſtrange reſtleſneſs, leſt it ſhould be the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, was very glad to hear the contrary by <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Barbara</hi>'s Meſſage. He had no more to ſay
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:135663:227"/> to this point than ſhe had, only that he was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he had not been ſeen. <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> who was not a Woman to be frighted with ſo ſmall a matter, did trouble her ſelf no further as to what might happen from this buſineſs, knowing well how to get out of it, and that ſhe would make that Perſon paſs for ridicule, that would accuſe her of any ſuch thing; ſhe ſent back Father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> to his Chamber, and took the way that led her to the Marchioneſs, to acquit her ſelf of thoſe Ceremonies uſed in ſuch caſes, not knowing how to diſpence her ſelf from them, though ſhe had no great inclination to go. She entred her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with a cold and indifferent Countenance, and found the Marchioneſs making an end of prepare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf for the Journey, and who afforded her as indifferent a reception; they were both for ſome time in that humour, not ſpeaking a word to one another, till that <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> who thought that ſhe had the only cauſe of Complaint, did break that ſilence, and told her, that ſhe was much amaz'd at the reception which ſhe did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford her that Morning. The Marchioneſs did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer her coldly, that there were certain days of Vexation, when a Perſon was very unfit for any thing, and that ſhe would have her to be the Judge of it, who appear'd not to be in a better humour her ſelf. <hi>I might have hoped however, Madam,</hi> reply'd the Governeſs, who was not ſatisfied with that excuſe, <hi>that after ſo much Complaiſance as I had for you in the Garden this Evening, which was ſo favourable to your Deſigns, you might have afforded me a better reception: But I perceive the buſineſs; you would have them that concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for you to be reſponſible of the ill ſucceſs
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:135663:227"/> that your deſires have had. You being the Perſon, Madam,</hi> reply'd the Marchioneſs, <hi>who did give the firſt motion to that Maſquerade, which you had not invented but for your own diverſion; I wonder, that after you had made me the Property in it, you ſhould yet demand of me ſome acknowledgment. Yes, Madam,</hi> reply'd <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> with a forc'd ſmile, <hi>if there had been no more in the caſe, but you know that if you have been my Property, I have been your Gull. The worſe for you, Madam,</hi> reply'd the Marchioneſs. <hi>Yes, the worſe indeed,</hi> reply'd the other, <hi>but do you know,</hi> added ſhe with a little tranſport, not being able to contain her Paſſion any longer, <hi>that I am very unfit to be employed in ſuch kind of Commerce. I am willing to believe it, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> reply'd the Marchioneſs, ſtill with the ſame coldneſs, <hi>but it is my Opinion, that no Perſon ſhould be vexed for rendring ſuch Services to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of which they themſelves ſtand in need. I need ſuch Services!</hi> reply'd ſhe. <hi>Who knows, Madam,</hi> reply'd the Marchioneſs, <hi>you are a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as I am, and one cannot—Ah! one can be aſſur'd,</hi> ſaid ſhe, ſtill fretting more and more, <hi>that if I am a Wife, it is without ſuch weakneſſes as diſhonour an Husband. It is true,</hi> replyed the Marchioneſs, who could forbear no longer from revenging her ſelf of that reproach, <hi>that it is very honourable for a Woman to go at midnight to viſit Priſoners, ſuch a one too, as upon whoſe account you would have me diſgrac'd, though I had never ſpoken to him. Priſoners!</hi> replyed <hi>Donna Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bara,</hi> in an accent very different from the former. <hi>Yes, Madam,</hi> continued the Rival, <hi>Priſoners, but I muſt confeſs that is an act of Charity, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd at ſuch an hour, and under a Religious Habit,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:135663:228"/> is of ſo great a Merit before God and Man, that it gives a perſon a due right of ſlandring all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Donna Barbara,</hi> whoſe quick and nimble wit had never wanted a repartee to all that was ſaid to her, did remain now ſtrangely confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo that ſhe only ſaid that ſhe underſtood her not. <hi>How! do you not underſtand me,</hi> replyed the Marchioneſs, who was reſolv'd to give it her home, <hi>ſtay a moment, and I will fetch you a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thing that ſhall expound to you more clearly what I ſay to you, and ſhall let you ſee, that it is from good hands that I have it.</hi> She meant the Glove, which ſhe went to ſeek for in a Cloſet that was in her Chamber. The Marqueſs, who had heard all that fine Dialogue, without med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the Diſpute, employing himſelf about ſomething elſe, was very much pleaſed that his Wife had given her ſuch a ſevere repulſe, and ſhe had never done any thing in the World that had pleaſed him ſo much as to have humbled that Lady, who was the proudeſt Woman in the World. He could have wiſh'd, to compleat his joy, that the Governour had been preſent, who came juſt in the time that the Marchioneſs was returning with <hi>Donna Barbara</hi>'s Glove. <hi>Here, Madam,</hi> ſaid ſhe, giving it her, <hi>judge by that Token whether I am well inform'd of the Adventure.</hi> The poor Lady was ſo caſt down with different thoughts, both at the ſight of that Glove, and at her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's unlucky arrival to make an end of ruining her, that ſhe retir'd, not being able to ſpeak one word more. The Governour, who did ſee her go ſo out of Countenance, and with a great fluſhing all over her Face, which did ſufficiently expreſs the diſturbance that was in her Soul, did enquire of the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:135663:228"/> Marqueſs, the matter with her; he told him that he muſt enquire of the Marchioneſs, and ſhe ſaid, that he muſt ask the Marqueſs: thus ſhifting him from the one to the other, without any other ſatisfaction. The Governour was not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well contented with this, and he would have gone to ſeek after his Wife, to know of her what occaſion ſhe had to ſeperate her ſelf after that manner from the Marchioneſs, had they not been on the point of going; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deferred his Information till his return, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that at the moſt it could be but ſome Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Quarrel, and knowing the humour of his, he did ſuppoſe that ſhe might have undertaken to make ſome Remonſtrances to the Marchioneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Pilgrim, which the other had not taken kindly; and therefore he did not trouble himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further about it. They all got into the Coaches, and drove on towards <hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> through which the Marqueſs would paſs going for <hi>Madrid.</hi> The Governour had had a deſign to acompany them a Journeys way from <hi>Barcelona,</hi> but that certain Words which the Marchioneſs had let fall by the way concerning <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> and the Pilgrim, which did bear double ſenſe, did give him more cauſe to think than was expected, and was the occaſion that he return'd home that Night. No great ſtore of diſcretion can be expected from Women in ſuch caſes, and there never was one yet that did ſpare her Rival, when ſhe could ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine her. <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> was paſſing away ſome very ſcurvey particles of time, as may be imagin'd after the late Encounter that ſhe had had with the Marchioneſs, who doubtleſs would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, as ſhe imagined, informing the Governour throughly of it: So that ſhe was in ſtrange diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:135663:229"/> till ſhe did ſee him go along with them, gueſſing by that, that he was not over angry with her; ſeeing he did not deſiſt accompanying them, as he had deſign'd it. After this ſhe began to Breath and Rejoice that ſhe had driven away the Marchioneſs from
<hi>Barcelona,</hi> and remained in ſole poſſeſſion of her Lover; ſhe preſently ſent to ſeek after her moſt dear Confident, to whom ſhe did relate what had paſſed between her and the Marchioneſs. Not conceiving from whom ſhe could have had all that Information, except it were the Marqueſs that had ſurpris'd them at the going out of the
<hi>Tower.</hi> Father <hi>Andrew</hi> did fear very much for himſelf, in caſe this buſineſs ſhould be known, not doubting but the ſhare he had in it, would make him fall heavily under the Governour's Anger, and made to bear the whole Burden. <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> did endeavour to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him, telling him that he knew a way how to prevent all the harms which might befall them; that they had two days to think of it, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Governour was not to return till the next Day, but that the Pilgrim was to be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to aſſent to it, in preſenting to him the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that their lives would be in if they ſhould ſtay till the Governour returned; and that of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity they muſt make their eſcape that Night, and get into <hi>France,</hi> where they ſhould not fear to want for any thing, becauſe ſhe would carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with her a ſufficient quantity of Jewels, to ſhelter them all from it. Father
<hi>Andrew,</hi> who would willingly be always the fartheſt from blows, did highly approve of this Advice, and he did not believe that the Pilgrim would make any difficulty of following them, ſeeing that beſides
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:135663:229"/> his liberty, which by that means he did recover, he could not but imagine that there was much more for him to fear than for them. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did conclude, that without a further delay they would go to him, and inform him in what a condition things were, and ſee whether the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition would pleaſe him. <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> had put up her
<hi>Friars</hi> Habit in one of her Cloſets, whence they took it out, and the Father was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain employed in the ſame Office as the Night before. After which they went to the Pilgrim, who was not a little ſurpris'd to ſee <hi>Donna Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bara</hi> return in the ſame Diſguiſe at that time o'th' Day. He could not forbear from expreſſing his trouble at it, and ſhe without hearkening unto him, ſaid, that ſhe came to inform him of two things; the firſt of them ſhe doubted not but would very much afflict him, which was, that the Marchioneſs was gone to remain in ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited Place, where ſhe was led by her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, that ſhe might never more be ſeen by any Body but him. The other was, that before the Ladies departure, ſhe had told the Governour of her going to ſee him the laſt Night, in a <hi>Friars</hi> Habit, as ſhe had learned it of the Marqueſs, which had met her, and Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> as they were going out of the Tower, from whoſe Hands ſhe had much to do to eſcape, with leaving one of her Gloves with him, which the Marchioneſs had ſhown to the Governour for Confirmation of what ſhe had ſaid; ſo that he might eaſily ſee what was to be done: That, as for her part, ſhe was fully reſolv'd to do whatſover he pleaſed, provided that he would take care of his own life, which was that which ſhe held moſt dear. Though
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:135663:230"/> 
                     <hi>Camille</hi> had prepared himſelf in order to his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the Marchioneſs, imagining that they would be gone before he was got out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; yet the news of it gave him a mortal Wound as to what the Governeſs ſaid; beſides, he did not add much Faith to it, and if he could have believ'd it, it had only afflicted him a little for the fear he would have had, that the beauteous Marchioneſs had believed he had contributed ſomething towards that Viſit; but apprehended nothing at all on the Marqueſs's account, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his Life, of which he was very careleſs at that time. <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> who perceived that he continued ſilent, which made her think that he was thinking of what he ſhould reſolve concerning what ſhe had propos'd to him, did preſs him to give his anſwer; it was time to fix upon ſomething, and to prepare for a flight, if he thought fit to ſave himſelf from the evil ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Governour's Fury, who being a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon very ſenſible of things of that Nature, he would be highly exaſperated. <hi>Camille,</hi> who did preſently perceive which way the Ladies De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns did tend, and who had choſen to dye ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to be troubled with her, did anſwer her very coldly, that he had acted nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Governour, which might draw his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſo ſeverely upon him, and that if he had been ſo unhappy as ſo to do, however he would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve her in his Miſery, and ſo to render her more guilty than ſhe really was.
<hi>Donna Barbara</hi> ſtruck to the Heart with ſo cold an anſwer, as much as a paſſionate Woman as ſhe was could be, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing her cruel rage, did tell him all that the Wit of a Woman could invent of moſt perſwading
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:135663:230"/> to engage him to yield to the propoſition which ſhe did make him, even in meer pitty to her ſelf, whom ſhe had loſt through the violent paſſion which ſhe had for him; adding to thoſe tender expreſſions ſuch Tears and Sighs as did tear ſome alſo from Father <hi>Andrew's</hi> Boſom, who did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare of her ſide, with his Eyes full of Tears, to perſwade this inſenſible Man to ſeek after his own liberty, which they did offer him, and to ſhun that Death which would be inevitable, if he ſhould ſtay the Governour's return; but the heard-heartd, or rather prudent <hi>Camille,</hi> who was not of ſo eaſie a Nature as was the Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that perceived better than he did, on which ſide lay the greateſt danger, did eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf againſt all thoſe Attempts; of which <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> being ſenſible, did then endeavour to make him apprehend all that a paſſionate and deſpiſed Woman could imagine of moſt cruel and wicked, to ruine him with; and finding that all thoſe threatnings did not move him neither, in that height of paſſion ſhe drew from under her <hi>Friars</hi> Gown a Stilleto, with a deſign to plunge it into her own Boſom, and if the Pilgrim had not been nimble in ſtaying of her Arm, and after that he had much to do to force that Weapon out of her Hands. Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who had been ſtrangely affrighted at the Attempt, was on his Knees, intreating the tranſported Lady not to kill her ſelf, and the Pilgrim to have Compaſſion of her, who at laſt was mov'd, not at his Requeſt, nor at her furious Rage, which had rather exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated him, ſeeing that all this did tend to make him miſerable, but unto thoſe Conſiderations which he had, that to ſhun one evil he ſhould
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:135663:231"/> create to himſelf divers others, if he ſhould drive that Woman into a deſpair: Therefore to reclaim her a little, he intreated her to deliver up that Dagger to him, and that he would do all that ſhe ſhould deſire. She did not part with it but on that condition, and breathing a little, <hi>Ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>that ſtays till I cauſe my own Death, before thou would'ſt grant me my Life. I know not, Madam, whether the way that we are going to take, will not bring you ſooner to your end, than the abiding here. No certainly,</hi> anſwer'd ſhe, <hi>for the Governour being not in Town, I have the means to draw you from hence without the leaſt danger; at the Port there are ſome Felouca's in readineſs to carry us to</hi> France, <hi>and I take with me that which ſhall ſecure you from want and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, except you reckon it a miſery to have in your Company a Woman that loves you with ſuch a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as I do. Camille</hi> did make her no Anſwer, to give her leave to think all that ſhe pleaſed, his deſign being to get out of Priſon, ſince it was to be ſo, whether he would or no, to ſhun greater evils, and not to humour the Amorous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricio's of a Woman, for whom he had never had the leaſt inclination. However, things were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as if he had reſolv'd to content her; and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was ſo tranſported with joy at it, that ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready thought her ſelf out of <hi>Barcelona</hi> with her dear Gallant. The Governeſs and the good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Andrew</hi> took leave of the Pilgrim to go or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their buſineſſes, and prepare for their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which was to be at Eleven at Night. The Father had all the outward Commiſſions in his charge, which were to hire the <hi>Felouca,</hi> to buy in Proviſions, and all other things neceſſary for
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:135663:231"/> a Voyage. And the Lady took upon her the care of all inward buſineſs, and to prevent all obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their flight: Finally, all things having been well regulated on her part, and Father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> having taken ſuch care as nothing ſhould be wanting on his ſide, when the hour was come they went to the <hi>Tower,</hi> where the Lady entered, being wholly tranſported with joy, and running immediately into her dear Pilgrim's Chamber, <hi>Come you muſt riſe,</hi> ſaid ſhe, ſeeing him lye upon the Bed with the Curtains drawn,
<hi>for it is time to be going, and we are Maſters as well of the Priſon as of the Pallace;</hi> and finding that he neither an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd nor mov'd, ſhe believ'd that he was aſleep, therefore ſhe drew open the Curtains to pull and awaken him, but when ſhe perceived the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who aroſe, it did ſet her on a ſudden into ſuch an amazement as may be imagin'd; which did ſo ſurpriſe her, that after ſhe had made an extream outcry, which affrighted Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who thought as little as ſhe did, to find the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour there, ſhe fell down backwards in a ſwoun. This Lord, more careful of his Honour than of his Wife, whoſe humour he had known long, and fearing more the divulging of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, than the effects thereof, having well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by all that the Marchioneſs had told him, that ſome things were acted within his Doors, which did not go well, he had thought that it would not be prudence in him to lye from home: He had been witneſs of the good-will which his Wife had expreſs'd for the Pilgrim, and making good uſe of the Marchioneſſes advice, had in a handſome manner taken leave of the Marqueſs, not ſhewing them the leaſt ſign of diſtubance,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:135663:232"/> and was return'd to <hi>Barcelona</hi> on a full gallop, where he came in the dark, judging that if there was any buſineſs in hand, his Wife would take the opportunity of his Abſence. Wiſe-men have always ſome fore-ſights of the miſchief that may befall them, and there are many in the World that would not have ſuch weights upon their Fore-heads, if they were as well inſpired as he was. Our Governour therefore being come into the City, had quitted his Horſe at the <hi>Arcenal,</hi> where having left his people alſo, he took one of his Servants Cloaks, went into the Palace, and from thence into the <hi>Tower,</hi> without being known by any body. There he ſpoke with him that had the Pilgrim in charge, who being none of
<hi>Donna Barbara</hi>'s Intelligence, did confeſs that he had let Father <hi>Andrew</hi> come to the Priſoner by the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Governeſſes Orders, who the firſt time had come to ſee him ſingly, but afterwards accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a little <hi>Friar</hi> of the ſame Order, and that the laſt Night they had been long together. There needed no more for a Man of underſtanding, as was the Governour, to unravel this Myſtery, and to gueſs who had been Father <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion in that Viſit, who was not us'd to go ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied in the Palace, and who had leſs occaſion to do ſo in going to viſit that Priſoner. He need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no further inſight in the buſineſs. He ſent the Goaler to the Port to hire a <hi>Felouca,</hi> who a moment after return'd to tell him, that there was but one, who had been retain'd by a <hi>Friar</hi> of S.
<hi>Dominick</hi>'s Order, who was to be gone that Night at Eleven. This News did almoſt diſtract him, not doubting any longer but that his Wife was reſolv'd to be gone with this Pilgrim, or at leaſt to help
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:135663:232"/> him to eſcape. This <hi>Spaniſh Flemne,</hi> who did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in him, did at laſt gain the upper hand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver divers deſperate Reſolutions which he had taken, and which he had been upon the very point of Executing upon his own Lady, rather than againſt an unfortunate ſtranger, who was not to be reſponſible of his Wifes follies; he took the Reſolutions therefore to break their meaſures without noiſe, and to oblige <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> to become wiſe by reaſon. He ſent the Goaler to the Pilgrim to get him out of the Priſon, and conduct him to that <hi>Felouca,</hi> which Father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> had hired, with expreſs Orders from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto the Watermen to be gone immediately, on pain of Impriſonment; and a Charge to the Pilgrim, of never returning to <hi>Barcelona,</hi> on pain of Death. This was accordingly Executed, with the greater ſatisfaction to <hi>Camille,</hi> who had no buſineſs in that City, and who was happily going out of Priſon, and quitted of that cruel Torment, in which he ſhould have been with the Governeſs.</p>
                  <p>The Goaler having acquitted himſelf of all his Commiſſions, the Governour had laid himſelf in the Pilgrim's place, charging the Goaler, not to tell of his being out of Priſon, and to let any in, that came to ſee him. Thus had the Governour carryed on the buſineſs; his Wifes accident did ſomewhat mitigate his wrath, and made him loſe the opportunity of ſeizing Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who he had reſolv'd ſhould have been kept in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for ſome time, in recompence of all the good and pious Offices which he had rendred to his Wife, none deſerving it better than he had done. But in a Retreat, Father <hi>Andrew</hi> was always one of the firſt, ſetting all his ſafety in his heels;
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:135663:233"/> ſo that he was already gone far, when the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was thinking to detain him. There was no more to do, but to take care of the Lady, who he was forced to lead himſelf into her Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after ſhe was a little recovered of her Swoun. How that breach was made up, I know not; for my Memoirs fail me there, but it is probable that the Governour's Reſentments laſted no longer than did his Ladies Paſſion, who was not long before ſhe was ingaged in a new Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry with a Cavalier, leſs cruel than our Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim.</p>

                  <head>THE PILGRIM. The Second Part.</head>
                  <p>IT was about break of Day when our Pilgrim, impatient to be on the Territories of
<hi>France,</hi> gets up to look about him, and to enquire what progreſs the Veſſel had already made in their Journey; for ſo long as he was on that fickle Element he thought himſelf unſafe, not knowing what new turn of Fortune might over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take him, and bring him back to viſit his late melancholick Lodgings: Beſides his happy and unexpected deliverance from a double Slavery, did appear to him ſo like a Dream, that he did ſtill remain in ſome apprehenſions of carrying along with him the worſt of his afflictions. This made him to enquire of the Maſter of the Veſſel, what other company there was with him: The Maſter told him, that there was none beſides a Fryar of St. <hi>Dominick</hi>'s Order, and a Woman: A Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? replyed
<hi>Camille,</hi> being ſtrangely ſurpriz'd; then am I as miſerable as ever, and find that I muſt never hope for any end to my misfortunes.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:135663:235"/> Had you Orders, continued he, to take in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon beſides my ſelf? Sir, replyed the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Father who hired it laſt night, did agree with me for the tranſporting of himſelf, and two other porſons, and your ſelf, the Father and that Woman make up that number, neither durſt take any more into my Bark, becauſe of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour's ſtrict Orders, that I ſhould immediately depart Our Pilgrim was ſo much troubled at what the Maſter had ſaid, that holding down his Head, his Hat drawn over his Face, his Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs, leaning on his Staff, with his Eyes fixed on the Deck, he ſtood as mute, as if he had been ſtruck with Thunder; but while he appear'd ſo like a Statue outwardly, his Heart was agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted within with ſuch a Confuſion of thoughts, as were the cauſe of his repreſenting ſo odd a Figure. Sometime he was thinking, what could be the reaſon that the wiſe Governour ſhould give ſuch ſtrict Charge to the Marriners for his immediate departure, and yet be ſo negligent in ſecuring of his Wife from getting into the Felouqua with him: Then again it did very much ſurprize him, that <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> ſhould change her mind as to her diſguiſe, and hazzard her ſelf in Woman's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel; but then it came to his thoughts, that it was peradventure for her better ſecurity, in caſe her Husband had been inform'd of the dreſs which ſhe had deſign'd to go in; and ſo by remaining in womans Apparel, had cheated him the ſecond time. By and by, again, his mind would be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied in making out, whether Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> and
<hi>Donna Barbara</hi> were got into the Veſſel, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to go along with him, or that they believing him ſtill a Priſoner in the red Tower, they had
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:135663:235"/> come thither to ſhelter themſelves from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour's preſent rage, and ſo had abandon'd him to the furious paſſions that a jealous man, of the Power and Authority that the Governour was, could employ in order to his ruin. If ſo, then of conſequence, thoſe orders that had been given to the Maſter as from the Governour, he did conclude to be of their own fabrick, to haſten the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Veſſel, for fear of a ſurpriſal. Theſe, and many other confuſed notions poſſeſſing his whole imagination, he remain'd unreſolv'd, not knowing what to conclude on: Once he was for diſcovering unto the Maſter, who that Fryar and that Woman were, which he had taken into his Veſſel, and ſo perſwade him he would do the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour a ſingular piece of Service, in carrying them back to
<hi>Barcellona:</hi> But he thought that it would be very difficult for him to prevail with the Maſter, againſt the Governour's poſitive Orders. Beſides, if it ſhould prove, that the two Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that were with him ſhould not be the Father and the Governeſs, it would be a great diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to himſelf to be carried back; he did believe that it was very unlikely, that at that time of the Night, and at ſuch a Critical moment, any other Fryar and Woman than them, could come ſo pat to embark themſelves in that very Veſſel that had been hired for them. This at laſt made him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the good Father and the Governour's Wife were in the Felouqua with him, yet that peradventure they might not know of his being there, which ſet him upon the deſign of concealing himſelf, that he might get on ſhore without their knowledge of his being there. In this laſt reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he goes to the Maſter, and having dropt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:135663:236"/> ſome Piſtols into his hand, he whiſpered to him that for ſome particular reaſons he would lye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the knowledge of thoſe two Perſons that were with him, that therefore he would be conveyed where he might remain unſeen, till the reſt were landed, and then that he would come to ſhore himſelf. The Maſter having return'd his thanks, took <hi>Camille</hi> by the hand, and having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him into a little hole like a Cabin, he left him with an aſſurance that there he might lye as ſecure as he pleas'd.</p>
                  <p>The Wind was ſo favourable, as in a ſhort time to convey them in view of <hi>Narbona,</hi> at which the Maſter of the Veſſel cry'd out aloud, that all might take notice of it; that who had a mind to go toſhore, ſhould begin to prepare for it. At theſe glad tidings, Father
<hi>Andrew,</hi> who had lain all the while as ſtill as a Dor-mouſe, riſes and goes to the Governeſs, telling her, that if ſhe pleas'd to look forth, ſhe might behold their wiſh'd for Harbour; but receiving no anſwer, he retired, concluding her aſleep, after her long Fatigue, and great Diſaſters. He gets upon the Deck and accoſts the Maſter in this manner; Are you ſure, ſaid he, that that is <hi>Narbona?</hi> pointing at the City, and in the
<hi>French</hi> Dominions: Yes, replyed the Maſter; at which good news, the Fryar's countenance was chang'd from melancholy, to as ſerene, as was the Weather. In the opinion, that <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> was not come away empty handed, he begins to build ſtrange Caſtles in the Air, in his imagination, making al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready a priſe of her and of her Treaſure; now that he did find himſelf out of the Governour's reach, and paſt being controul'd by the abandoned Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim, in that height of thoughts, he has not Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:135663:236"/> to remain any longer mew'd up within the narrow compaſs of a Boat, which made him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto the Lady, and intreat her to ariſe, and prepare to go to ſhore, but having no anſwer yet, he employs his hands, where the darkneſs of the place did deprive him of the uſe of his Eyes, and finding that the Lady was not concern'd at his touch, he adventures further, and meets with her face, which finding warm and breathing, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends lower with the ſame hand, where finding her Breaſts, he made bold with them. This free acceſs, without the leaſt repulſe, did ſo embolden our jolly Fryar, that he did venture to convey his other hand lower, when on the ſuddain, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a ſevere rebuke, accompanied with a thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring voice, and preſently getting off of the Bed, ſhe went to that little light that came in by the Door. The good Father, who had not been a little ſurpriz'd at the ſtrangeneſs of the accident, believing that he had miſtaken one place for another, was making towards the Door to retrieve his way, when he was ſeiz'd by the Arm, which put him to a ſtand, but had you ſeen in what a dreadful fear the poor Father was, when lifting up his Head, he eſpy'd a Face as black as any that ever came from the <hi>Affrican</hi> ſhore; which looking upon him with a pair of ſtaring Eyes, cryed out in the ſame tone as before, preſſing his hand, you would never have forgot it.</p>
                  <p>You may eaſily imagine that the good Father <hi>Andrew</hi> at this Apparition, was not in any great humour of making long compliments, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he was ſo deſirous to be gone from that black Companion, that running haſtily out, he ſtruck his Head with ſuch a force againſt the Door
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:135663:237"/> frame, as did caſt him backwards flat on his back in a ſwoon. The Mooriſh Woman ſeeing him lye ſpeechleſs on the floor, weltring in his blood, did ſtoop to him, and ſetting up her voice, to call for help as well as ſhe could, and to bemoan the poor Father; ſhe began to howl much after the manner of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> at their Funerals. At this hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous noiſe the Maſter run to learn what was the matter, which having ſeen, he preſently went to <hi>Camille</hi> and told him that the Father was fallen backwards dead, he knew not by what accident, and that there was no body with him, beſides the Mooriſh Woman, which he had brought along with him the laſt night. <hi>Camille</hi> learning by this, that
<hi>Donna Barbara</hi> was not there, went to ſee what was the matter; he found the poor Father, as the Maſter had told him, in a very ſad pickle: He caus'd him to be taken up and brought in a Chair upon the Deck, in the open Air; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after that the good Father had drank a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Wine, which was given him, he began to look about him, while <hi>Camille</hi> was gone to ſee who that Woman might be. He was not long before he learned of her, that ſhe was <hi>Donna Barbara's</hi> Slave; who having engaged to be ready to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with her Lady, and thinking the hour at hand; ſhe had got to the appointed Poſt on the Port, whence in the obſcurity of the Night ſhe had been led into the Veſſel, where ſhe thought that her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was before diſpos'd of.</p>
                  <p>While that this account had been given at one end of the Felouqua, Father <hi>Andrew</hi> at the other end having perceiv'd the Marriners flocking about him, he preſently fancied that they were Men ſent by the Governour's orders to diſpatch him, in that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:135663:237"/> belief, the very apprehenſion of Death, though he ſeem'd half dead already, did make him cry out, that he was innocent, that he knew not where was <hi>Donna Barbara Day amonte,</hi> the Governour of <hi>Barcellona's</hi> Wife, and that if they killed him, they would murther a harmleſs man, a Religious man, and one of the Order of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> who was a Father Confeſſor alſo, for which Crime they ſhould one day ſeverely anſwer: Look, look, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, ſpeaking to thoſe who were about him, whether you can find any ſuch perſon here? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I ever deſign the ſetting of the Pilgrim at liberty, for he was yet in the red Tower, when I went from <hi>Barcellona,</hi> he was thus going on plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for life, when thoſe men that were about him ſtaring on him, were call'd away, and <hi>Camille</hi> appearing preſently to him, he was by that ſet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a greater fright than ever, which he ſhew'd by endeavouring to get away: <hi>Camille</hi> took him by the hand, and told him that he needed not to fear, becauſe there was no perſon near him that would do him any injury, that he ſhould take his word for it, whom he knew to be his friend: By this time the poor Father
<hi>Andrew</hi> having with much ado lifted up his Eyes, and perceived <hi>Camille;</hi> and are you here, Sir, ſaid he, and all alone too, then do I breath again; with that he fetch'd a deep ſigh, after which he thus continued; and I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to believe that all that has lately happen'd unto me, has been meer deluſion, and a temptation of the Devil; then lifting his hand to his head, which pain'd him; yet there muſt be ſomthing real in the caſe, continued he, or how ſhould I feel all this ſmart elſe? And above all things, I wonder moſt how the Devil did put that black
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:135663:238"/> fantaſme into my hand in the dark, in lieu of the Governeſs?
<hi>Camille</hi> finding that he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fall into a melancholly paſſion, if not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, deſired him to reſt ſatisfied, and that he would give him a true account of all, ſo ſoon as he ſhould be got on ſhore, and that his hurts were dreſt: Why, am I wounded then, ſaid the good Father again, with a great emotion of Spirit: Yes, replyed <hi>Camille,</hi> but not by thoſe means which you fancy, but reſt your ſelf contented, rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and all things ſhall be well again, and you ſhall have but the hurt on't, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ill conſequence: Then <hi>Camille</hi> commanded ſome Perſons that were by, to carry him to ſhore, which being done, he was dreſt and put in a Bed, and <hi>Camille</hi> and the poor Father did remain at <hi>Narbona,</hi> till he was perfectly cured of his broken head.</p>
                  <p>The next day the Veſſel returned to <hi>Barcellona,</hi> whither the Mooriſh Woman was convey'd back, according to <hi>Camille's</hi> orders, where you are to know, that the Governour had with much pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſecrecy, convey'd his half-dead Wife into her Chamber, where he had left her to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her ſelf, while he went out to order ſome of his Servants to ſeek every place in the Palace for Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> and to bring him immediately along with them, pretending that his Wife being fallen deſperately ill on the ſuddain, ſhe had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for him: The Governour's deſign in this, was to catch Father <hi>Andrew</hi> before he were gone, and to bring him to ſevere puniſhment, after he ſhould have vented his paſſion in words upon him and the Governeſs, and yet ſo order the matter, as that the true cauſe of all theſe diſorders ſhould
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:135663:238"/> be conceal'd from his Servants knowledge, and that he might give his Wife time ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect her ſelf, that ſhe and her Factor might with more patience hear what he ſhould ſay to them, he did retire into another Chamber, where he expected that the Fryar ſhould be brought to him, not doubting but that he ſhould be found ſomewhere about the Palace, he having caus'd all the Gates to be ſhut up, ſo ſoon as he had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their deſigns: But he reckoned without his Hoſt, the Bird was flown, ſo that having waited a long time, after which his Servants being return'd without their prey, he deſign'd to return to his Wife and give her her leſſon. But mean time, ſhe having been inform'd that her Husband had ſent for her Agent, and judging that it was to bring them together, to let ſly his revenge upon them both at once; ſhe had retired into thoſe lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which were lately the Marchioneſſes, where ſhe had lock'd her ſelf up, ſending back that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that had gone with her, to tell her Husband where ſhe was retired, to obſerve his motions, and to give her an account of his proceedings againſt Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> that by them ſhe might take her meaſures, and judge of his deſigns againſt her ſelf. The Governour miſſing of his Wife, ask'd where ſhe was, and having been told that ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved her felf into the Marchioneſſes late lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, where ſhe had lock'd her ſelf up, with a deſign to lye there that night; he troubled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf no further about it, but went to Bed, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Schooling of her againſt the next day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> being alone in that Chamber, had too many things in her head to think of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:135663:239"/> ſleep; ſhe intended to employ her time better, in contriving which way to defeat her Husband's deſigns of railing at her; ſhe had too high a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, calmly to bear his injuries and reproaches, and ſhe was reſolv'd one way or other to prevent his Fury. She had opened the Window, to let in the cool Air of the Night, to refreſh her fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Heart; and ſhe was looking out, when caſting her eyes towards the ſhore, ſhe did perceive, as well as the light of the Moon, which then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to riſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would permit her at that diſtance, a perſon that was coming from the Sea ſhore to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Palace, who being drawn nearer, did appear to her in a Pilgrims Habit. It came pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently into her head, that it might be
<hi>Camille,</hi> who being got out of Priſon, and not believing what ſhe had told him of the Marchioneſs's abſence, was come under that Window, in hopes to ſee the Marchioneſs, or to learn by ſome means or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which fortune might produce in his favour, whether the Lady was gone, or ſtill in her old quarters. <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> did further imagin, that the Pilgrim not daring to return to his old lodings, or be too buſie in enquiring elſewhere, for fear of being retaken, and worſe uſed than at firſt, he had thought it his beſt courſe to come there himſelf, for information; having prepoſſeſt her ſelf with this conceit, as all perſons are apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that which they moſt deſire, ſhe dropp'd down one of her Gloves, that it might cauſe him to look up and take notice of the ſigns that ſhe did make him to have him ſtay a while The thing ſucceeded as ſhe had deſir'd, for after the Pilgrim had taken up the Glove, and found by its ſtrong perfume, that it did not belong to an ordinary
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:135663:239"/> hand, he lifted up his head, and perceiv'd ſome body that did make him ſigns, as if they would have him to ſtay a little, after which they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew.</p>
                  <p>This Perſon who had taken up the Glove, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being a Pilgrim that was newly come to ſhore, and was going in Pilgrimage to St. <hi>Jago,</hi> having no other buſineſs at <hi>Barcellona,</hi> but to ſeek for a lodging for that night, and to proceed on his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney forwards the next morning, was willing to wait and ſee what the ſucceſs of this would be, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſtayed there, walking up and down till <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> having writ her mind, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed it into the other Glove, ſhe likewiſe did drop it before him. He preſently took it up, finds the paper in it, which he takes out, unfolds, and reads, as well as he could; but ſome clouds at that inſtant obſcuring the Air, ſo that he could not make an end, he looks up, but finds that the Perſon was retired, and the Window ſhut. Now this Pilgrim being one of thoſe perſons, that like the generality of thoſe foot Travellers, was light enough of Money in ready Caſh, but who are as well provided and ſtored with Jeſts, Songs, and merry Tales as our Country Fidlers, fitted to all ſorts of humours and conditions, which amongſt thoſe kind of perſons are as good as ſo many Bills of exchange, payable at firſt ſight; for through the Authority of thoſe Letters of Credit, and ſome little pretty <hi>Agnus Dei's,</hi> little Croſſes, Chaplets, Medals, and the like Toyes, they paſs every where, and make bold to ſeek for Lodgings, and all other conveniences, in all places, in all companies and at all times.

                  <p>
                     <hi>In ſpight of all my Enemies Contrivances, Plots, and Deſigns, I have kept my Station: If you continue in the generous deſign of freeing me from the cruel Tyranny of a Jealous Husband: This next night between one and two repair here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and bring a long with you a Ladder of Ropes, by the help of which, maugre all my Guardians Circumſpections, and</hi> Donna Barbara<hi>'s Intelligences, you ſhall receive into your protection the Marchioneſs of, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And a little beneath, by way of Poſtſcript, was writ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Excuſe my bad writing through the want of light: Get in readineſs a Felouqua againſt that time, which may carry us to ſome Sea Port of</hi> France. <hi>You need not to fear the Charges; for I ſhall bring that along with me, that ſhall be ſufficient to defray all, and put us beyond want.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At every period of this Letter, the Pilgrim would make a pawſe, then read it over again; but when he came to the Poſtſcript, where menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made of ſufficiency to defray the Charges, and to put them beyond want, he did read that place twenty times over, and having look'd once again on the word Marchioneſs, all thoſe little diſtruſts and jealouſies, which had poſſeſt him
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:135663:240"/> during the reading of the Letter, did vaniſh into Air, and as if the word Marchioneſs had fill'd him with another Spirit than his own, he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve within himſelf to act that perſon's part, for whom he was taken; thus he reſolv'd to take op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity by the foretop, and not to part with her till he had built his own Fortune. To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage himſelf in this reſolution, he calls for the beſt that the houſe would afford, enquires if there were not a Marchioneſs that lay in the Palace, who had a Jealous Husband: He is anſwered that there was ſuch a one, but that it was reported that her Husband was gone with her the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before; The news of the Marquis, and of his Ladies abſence did make him build the ſtronger upon that bottom, in lieu of deterring him, ſo that he long'd till the time was come to get off the Lady.</p>
                  <p>To that purpoſe, as ſoon as it was convenient to ſtir forth, he pays his reckoning, and goes out to hire a Felouqua, to provide a Ladder of Ropes, with all other neceſſaries for the Voyage, which all his little ſtock would but juſt reach to; but while he was buſie about this, a ſmall ſcruple a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe in his mind, which was, that doubtleſs the right Perſon intended to be employ'd by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs, could be no leſs than ſome perſon of quality, which made him fear, that when the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhould diſcover his Pilgrims weeds, ſhe might find out her miſtake, retire before he had her ſure, and ſo leave him at all the Coſt and Charges, to his utter ruin: This conſideration was of weight; but he knew no other way to remedy it, than in pretending, that he made uſe of that Habit to be diſguis'd, and that through its favourable aſpect,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:135663:241"/> they might paſs with more ſafety into the Felouqua. This, with the proſpect which he had of making his Fortune, did cauſe him to puſh on, and to venture at all, leaving the ſucceſs to the diſpoſal of Fortune, who commonly aſſiſts the bold. With this laſt reſolution he continues his deſigns, and gets all things in readineſs againſt the appointed hour; which being come, out goes our Pilgrim, and gets under the Window whence he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the firſt Summons; he was not long there before he heard it open, and preſently after a Cord was let down, at which he having faſtned the Ladder of Ropes, it was preſently pull'd up again, and not long after <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> came down by it, cloſe mufled up, leaſt that the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim ſhould find out her deceit; ſhe did no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er touch ground, but telling him in a diſguiſed tone, that there was no time to loſe, for fear of a purſuit, ſhe pull'd him along by the Arm, not giving time to anſwer, which pleas'd him very well, who was as willing as ſhe was to keep ſilence, ſo that they both haſten'd to the Veſſel, in equal fears of being diſcovered by one another: So ſoon as they were come to the Felouqua, the Maſter diſpos'd of them ſeverally, as the Lady deſired, and preſently they put off to Sea, making all the Sails they could for <hi>Narbona.</hi>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:135663:241"/> though to no effect; he went thither himſelf, where having divers times call'd and knock'd at the Chamber door to as little purpoſe, he caus'd it to be broke open, and his anger being exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperated by his Wife's reſiſtance, he preſently ruſhes into the Chamber, ſearches all Chambers for her, runs from one place to another, peeps in every hole and corner, but finds nothing but a Paper that lay upon the Table, in which there was writ; that ſhe being not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the affronts and reproaches, with which he had threatned her, he could not take it ill, that ſhe had abſented her ſelf for ſome time, only till his anger was over, and that he had alter d his reſolutions; for ſhe could not imagin, that her endeavouring to releaſe an innocent diſtreſſed Gentleman, was ſuch a Crime as deſerv'd ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere an uſage, as he deſign'd her. Though he was a Perſon that naturally had a great power over his paſſions, yet ſeeing himſelf over-reach'd by a Woman, he fell into ſuch a rage, that ſtorming, and threatning all the Servants, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acceſſaries to her flight, they at laſt went their ways and left him alone to vent his anger at leiſure.</p>
                  <p>After the firſt tranſports were over, he began more calmly to conſider with himſelf, what he had beſt to do, and what courſe to take to retrieve this fugitive Woman. Being vex'd with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for having expreſs'd ſo much paſſion before his Servants, and publiſhed ſo much of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns; but as to that, there was no remedy, and all that was to be done now, was how to get his Wife home again; but firſt how and where to meet with her. This he knew not how to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:135663:242"/> go about, having not the leaſt knowledge of the courſe that ſhe had ſtear'd, he reſolves a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand things in his mind, and as often defeats them again with new conſiderations, not knowing on which to pitch: Sometimes he is for one expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, then preſently again he layes that by, and he takes up another; ſometimes he is of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that it is the wicked Father <hi>Andrew</hi> that has aſſiſted his Wife in her eſcape, at other times he is of opinion, that it is the Pilgrim, who not obeying his order, had lain lurking thereabout to accompliſh this wicked buſineſs, then ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he was in the belief, that they both had a hand in the Plot: Thus being perplex'd with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers uncertainties, not knowing what courſe to take, he goes to the Window which had been left open, where he finds ſome certain marks of his Wife's eſcape that way, there he ſets himſelf down, and after a long debate within himſelf, he concludes that his Wife, imagining that the Pilgrim had followed the Marchioneſs to <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſſa,</hi> ſhe had made what haſte ſhe could with the Fryars aſſiſtance, to go after him, and to gain him for her ſelf, before that he had time to renew his friendſhip with the Marchioneſs. Amongſt a thouſand conceptions finding this the moſt probable; he reſolves for <hi>Saragoſſa</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately; but receiving that day ſome orders, which required his preſence for three days at <hi>Barcellonna,</hi> he was forc'd to obey, and defer his purſuit till that buſineſs was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                  <p>Mean time our Travellers are come to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor before <hi>Narbona,</hi> the Maſter gives them notice of it; the Pilgrim appears firſt upon the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:135663:242"/> Deck, trembling at the very thoughts of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching and diſcovering his deceit to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: He had been there ſome time, when one came to him to tell him, that the Lady would have him come to her, in her Cabin. The Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim with much perplexity and diſorder did obey the Commands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> had made the place as obſcure as ſhe could, to prevent a ſurprizal, deſiring to diſcover her ſelf to <hi>Camille</hi> little by little, and to obtain his pardon for the change that ſhe had put upon him; after which ſhe would endeavour to gain his affections. The Pilgrim comes in, and with much ado feeling out the Bed that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy lay on; he throws himſelf on his knees by the Bed ſide, and was going to ask pardon for his preſumption; when <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> did interrupt him in this manner, <hi>Sir, there is no Woman in the World who having received ſo great a favour as I have lately from you, but would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge her ſelf infinitely oblig'd unto your generous aſſiſtance for it; yet, Sir, the caſe is ſuch at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that I muſt attribute the cauſe of my preſent liberty, more to my good Fortune, than to your endeavours, when I look upon all that you have lately done, as intended to ſome other perſon than my ſelf. Madam,</hi> replyed the Pilgrim, <hi>I am come to acknowledge my Crime, and moſt humbly beg your pardon, for having been ſo bold, as to take upon me the performance of that which was deſign'd for a worthier hand, than that of a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Pilgrim; and I do own my ſelf ſo unworthy that honour, that I muſt wholly attribute to my good Fortune that happineſs, which another more worthy might deſervedly challenge from his own
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:135663:243"/> merits. You cannot be wanting in that,</hi> replyed <hi>Donna Barbara, except it be that your Cruelty does drown with ingratitude, all thoſe advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and excellencies that the Heavens have ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſely ſhowred upon you; and in that lyes my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, that while you are endeavouring to oblige a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, you ſet forth your unkindneſs to me, and are perſwading me to believe, how ready and willing you are to ſerve others, while I am to be left unregarded, or that if you chance to do me ſome kind Office, it is againſt your will, and by meer accident. Madam,</hi> replyed the Pilgrim, <hi>ſince it has pleas'd the Fates to make me by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that inſtrument of your ſafety, which your judicious choice had deſign'd unto another, be pleas'd to allow of their determination, and to aceept of my moſt humble Services, in order to your future deſigns.</hi> This unexpected anſwer did ſo ſurprize <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> that ſhe remained for ſome time without anſwering, which gave the Pilgrim time to add; I am the more excuſable, Madam, in having undertaken nothing but what I had your commands for, under your own hand, wherein reading your reſolutions, and fearing that my receiving of your orders might probably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint thoſe perſons for whom they were meant, by which you would loſe that opportunity which might never be recovered again. I thought that I could do no leſs than ſupply that place, which I have done, but in order to ſerve you; Madam, if you think fit to make any further uſe of me, I am ready to obey you in what elſe you will be pleas'd to command me, but if my unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs does invite you to caſt me off, let me but have the happineſs to accompliſh the reſidue of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:135663:243"/> my Pilgrimage under the favourable aſſiſtance, and recommendation of your illuſtrious Name; and I ſhall reſt contented with the honour of having ſerv'd you once, and ſhall ever add ſome words in my petitions to St. <hi>Jago,</hi> for a bleſſing on all your deſigns. This great fall from the Pilgrims firſt expreſſions, did fully confirm
<hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Barbara,</hi> that ſhe had been miſtaken in the Perſon, but however the ſatisfaction which ſhe had of being out of her Husbands reach, with the hopes ſhe had of meeting with the right Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim at <hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> did make her reſt ſatisfied for the preſent, and to give him this anſwer: I muſt confeſs that I ſhould not ſo willingly nor ſo eaſily have truſted my ſelf in the hands of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo abſolute a ſtranger to me as you are, had I had my choice; but ſeeing that it has ſo hapned, and that you are willing to ſerve me further, I will make uſe of you in ſending you to ſhore, to get the beſt and readleſt conveniency that can be had to carry me to <hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> where I would have you to accompany me, and there I ſhall return you thanks proportionable to the ſervices which you ſhall have rendred me, mean time, take this, continued ſhe, giving him a handful of Piſtols to defray the Charges, and ſo ſoon as you have provided all things for the Journey, come and fetch me hence.</p>
                  <p>The Pilgrim received <hi>Donna Barbara</hi>'s orders with much earneſtneſs, and her Gold with as much greedineſs; and having aſſured her that he would make all the haſte poſſible, he went to ſhore, where he provided all things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for her conveyance to the place that ſhe deſired, and return'd to her again at the cloſe of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:135663:244"/> the Evening, giving her an account of what he had done; preſently after the Maſter of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel was pay'd for his freight, and <hi>Donna Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> was conducted to ſhore by the Pilgrim, from whence they were convey'd inceſſantly to <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſſa.</hi> At the laſt days journey ſhe ſent her new ſervant before to provide her ſome Lodgings as private as poſſible, in ſome by place of the City, to which ſhe would go in the evening, that ſhe might not be ſeen. Which he did with ſuch diligence, that he came back again, and met her two or three miles diſtance from the City, whence in the Evening he led her to her lodgings</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> found her ſelf to have no further occaſion of the Pilgrim, ſhe gave him a very conſiderable gratuity for his Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and returning him thanks, ſhe ſent him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                  <p>Our Pilgrim being fluſhed with what he had receiv'd for his four or five days Services, went to ſeek for a lodging for himſelf; he had quickly found one at a publick Houſe, where he met alſo with ſome of his Country-men, with whom having made acquaintance, they ſupp'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at the Pilgrims coſt, who would treat them; and after Supper, they fell a drinking ſo hard, that they were all in their Altitudes, eſpecially our Pilgrim, who being puff'd up with the honour which he had receiv'd in ſerving a Marchioneſs, and in that gallant manner too, beſides the thought which came into his head, of the great reward which he had receiv'd for it; that nothing would ſerve his turn at laſt, but the Marchioneſs's Health, which he began with a full brimmer; which Health he oblig'd the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:135663:244"/> to pledge, twice over; one amongſt them being ſomewhat more peeviſh than the reſt, had not ſo much Complaiſance, as to do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grumbling; and amongſt the reſt of his mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings, he ſaid, why muſt we drink twice over a Womans Health, whoſe name we know not? Nay, nor I neither, replyed the Pilgrim; but thus much I will tell you, to invite you to it; that ſhe is young, beautiful, wiſe, and as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as a Princeſs: and pulling his Purſe out of his Pocket, and ſhaking it: here are golden wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of what I ſay, with part of which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to defray all your Charges here, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, continued he, and therefore pray fall too, and ſpare not: After two or three Cups more round the Table, at the requeſt of the company, he gave them an account of his coming acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with her, and aſſiſting of her in makng her eſcape from a jealous Husband, and how he had waited on her to <hi>Saragoſſa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At laſt they drank ſo long, that they were all paſt drinking, and it was ſo late, that the Maſter of the Houſe came and deſired the Company to get to their Beds, if they could find them, for that Night, telling them that the next day would be long enough for them to ſing the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part to the ſame Tune, if they pleas'd: With that our brave Pilgrim having diſcharg'd the reckoning, was led into his Chamber, and put to Bed, and the reſt of the Company did the like.</p>
                  <p>The next morning one of the Marqueſſes Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants coming to that Houſe to viſit one that had lately been his fellow Servant, he is informed of a certain Pilgrim newly come from

                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:135663:245"/> who had talk'd much of a Marchioneſs, and that he had drank her Health, with ſome of his own Country men, till they were paſt drinking for that bout. The Fellow hearing this, without any further inquiry into the Buſineſs, concluding within himſelf, that it was the ſame Pilgrim that they had left in priſon at <hi>Barcellona,</hi> he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly returns home with this news to his Maſter, aſſuring him that the Pilgrim by ſome means or other being got out of Priſon at <hi>Barcellona,</hi> was come thither. There needed no more to ſet our Jealous Marqueſs on the fret; he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tells the Fellow that he had ſo great a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in him, that he would leave the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that buſineſs to him, not doubting but he would faithfully ſerve him in it: Which was to get that Pilgrim to be put in Priſon, to that purpoſe he writes a Note to a Juſtice who was ſomething akin to him, to have the buſineſs done out of hand, letting him know that it was a great Malefactor who had broke out of Priſon at <hi>Barcellona,</hi> where he was detain d for horrid Crimes, and was come into that City under the diſguiſe of a Pilgrim: He immediatly ſent his Servant about it, aſſuring him that he would conſider his care and diligence in the buſineſs; and gave him a ſpecial charge to ſee him caſt in Priſon, and loaded with Irons, with a ſtrict or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that no body ſhould be admitted to ſpeak with him: Preſently after the poor Pilgrim was taken out of his Bed with his Cloaths half on and half off, and dragg'd to Priſon like a Dog, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the cruel manner which they uſually do in that Country, where he remained a cloſe Priſoner.</p>
                  <p>While things were in this poſture at the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Saragoſſa, Camille,</hi> little dreaming how he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:135663:245"/> was uſed there, was recovering of Father <hi>Andrew</hi> at
<hi>Narbona,</hi> that they might in diligence over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Marqueſs at <hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> where he hoped he would make ſome little ſtay; and finding that the good Father was in a Condition to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the Journey, and as willing to ſerve him as ever, to which purpoſe
<hi>Camille</hi> had given him to underſtand that he was a Perſon capable of protecting him from all dangers, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiting him very bountifully. They ſet forwards towards
<hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> where being arriv'd, it was their lot to Inn at the very houſe, whence the Pilgrim had been taken out.</p>
                  <p>The next morning after their arrival, Father <hi>Andrew</hi> was enquiring of his hoſt whether he knew not of a certain Marqueſs and Marchioneſs that were lately come into that City from
<hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellona?</hi> The Hoſt made anſwer, that there was a Merchioneſs, or Marqueſs, or ſomething of that quality, that was lately come from <hi>Barcello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> who liv'd very privately, not far from thence, which he had heard of by he could not remember whom: Preſently the good Father runs to <hi>Camille,</hi> and acquaints him of the diſcovery which he had already made, at which they both concluded by ſeveral circumſtances, that it muſt of neceſſity be the beautiful Marchioneſs, who it was probable was kept up ſo privatly by her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. The next thing was how to get her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of their being come to <hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> with the ſame deſign of ſerving her, as they had, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd at <hi>Barcellona;</hi> there lay the difficulty, which could not be removed but by a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Information of the place, and ſituation of her Lodgings. To this purpoſe the Landlord is call'd up, and employed to go and learn exactly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:135663:246"/> where thoſe perſons lay, and preſently after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns with full Information; upon which <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi> and the Father take their meaſures. They having debated and concluded on ſomething: Father <hi>Andrew</hi> is ſent to go take private Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings near that place, but as he goes down Stairs he meets with his Hoſt whom he takes along with him, to ſhew him the Houſe wherein the Marchioneſs lay. The Father having taken good notice of it, ſends back mine Hoſt, and takes Lodgings cloſe by it; after which return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to
<hi>Camille,</hi> he gave him an account of what he had done, and preſently they caus'd their goods to be remov'd. They being in their new Lodging; the next thing which was thought on was, that Father <hi>Andrew</hi> ſhould inſinuate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the Company of the Marqueſs his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, to learn of him how things were; that was preſently done, and in a ſhort time the good Father was inform'd, that he did not know what perſons liv'd in his Houſe, nor how many they were; that he had never ſeen any of them, but one Maid Servant; that if they were ſuch great perſons, as had been reported, they had doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for ſome great reaſon and deſign left their retinue behind them, and liv'd extraordinarily retired, never ſtirring out of their Chamber, where all their neceſſaries were brought to them by that only Maid: The Father having been thus far informed, enquired, if it were not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to have a Letter delivered unto the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, unknown to her Husband? He was anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he did not know whether there was a Husband or no in the caſe, and did believe that if ſhe had one he was not with her at that time.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:135663:246"/> With that a Maid going by, here is their Servant, continued he, I will call her to you, and ſhe ſhall inform you her ſelf of that better than I can. He call'd the Maid, who being come, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Andrew</hi> inquired of her, whether the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs was with his Lady, and if it were not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to give her a Letter without his knowledge, to which all the anſwer that he could get was, that ſhe was not yet ſo weary of her place, as to loſe it, that ſhe lik'd it ſo well, as to have no deſire to part with it to another; that ſhe knew well enough what ſhe had to do, and that he ſhould mind his own buſineſs, and not go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to get her place from her; and having ſaid this, ſhe went away, with a great deal of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. The good Father found by this ſmall Tryal, that no good was to be expected that way, he therefore bethought himſelf of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother expedient, and with fair words and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes did require of the Maſter of the Houſe that he would lend him the Key of his Garden door, that at night he might get into it, where he made no queſtion but by ſome means or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he would find out ſome way to let the Lady know of his being there, which ſhe would be very glad to hear. The Landlord making ſome doubts at it, pretending that he might by that means loſe his Lodgers, the ingenious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did preſently remove thoſe ſcruples, in dropping in his hand a Piſtol or two, which put the Key of the Garden door into his poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The good Father would willingly have been fully inform'd, whether the Marqueſs was with his Wife or not; but after divers at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and to no purpoſe, he went home, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:135663:247"/> being perſwaded by divers circumſtances that he was abſent.</p>
                  <p>Being returned home, he inform'd <hi>Camille</hi> of all that he had done, telling him that it were his own fault, if he got not the Lady immediately, while her Husband was abſent. <hi>How do you know that he is abſent?</hi> replyed <hi>Camille. As for my part I am not very well aſſured that this is the right Marchioneſs, and I fear leaſt you may miſtake in this, as when you took the Moor for</hi> Donna Barbara. To which Father <hi>Andrew</hi> ſaid, <hi>give me leave to tell you ſome circumſtances, and to put ſome conſequences into your head, and then judge whether it can be any other perſon than the Marchioneſs. They are lately come hither from</hi> Barcellona, <hi>where they are very private; as to their being with no other Servant than one ſingle Maid, thus I make it out; the Marqueſs having it is probable ſome buſineſs, which call'd him from hence, and fearing, leaſt in his abſence you ſhould clear your ſelf to the Governour of</hi> Barcellona <hi>ſo as to be releas'd preſently after, and that you might follow after him, he to conceal his Wife from your knowledge, had left his retinue at ſome ſmall diſtance from the City; and to make the leſs noiſe, had brought his Wife in the night, only accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with her two Guardian Women, and that ſerving Maid who was to attend them, with charge never to ſtir forth of her Chamber till his return, after which he might return to his Servants, and take them along with him.</hi> This is the beſt way that he could take in ſuch a caſe, replyed <hi>Camille,</hi> I muſt confeſs, were he forc'd upon ſome ſuch extraordinary occaſion, to have left his Wife behind him; but I fear that nothing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:135663:247"/> could perſwade him to do ſo: Yes, replyed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

All theſe are conjectures and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities: It may, and it may not be ſo, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Camille,</hi> and neither you nor I can inform our ſelves better: Well, put the caſe we are in the right, what is next to be done, continued <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le?</hi> This replyed the Fryar; you muſt have a Letter in readineſs for her; you muſt beſides make ſome kind of Song or Verſes, which you may Sing at night under her Window, in which you muſt give her to underſtand, in covered terms, that you are here in order to receive her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: The conſequence of this, replyed <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi> will be, that we ſhall alarm her Guardians, who will reward us with the ſame preſents as the Marqueſs receiv'd at <hi>Barcellona;</hi> and that at the Marqueſs his return, they will inform him of the buſineſs, and ſo our deſign will be loſt, and all hopes of ſetting on foot any other by our diſcovery. To this I anſwer, reply'd the Father, that you muſt not mention any thing that can be underſtood, but by the Marchioneſs her ſelf; that though the Guardians are awakned, we ſhall find ſome way to convey the Letter privately to the Marchioneſs, and that we ſhall after that, through her own aſſiſtance, get her off before the Marqueſs his return. Well, reply'd <hi>Camille,</hi> it is but the venturing of a ſuit of Cloaths, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:135663:248"/> my Theorbo, I will give you the ſatisfaction of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with you at night, and to that purpoſe I wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>At night <hi>Camille,</hi> and Father <hi>Andrew</hi> came to the Garden door of the Marchioneſſes Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the Father goes to open it, but after he had fumbled a good while without ſucceſs, they were forc'd to leave the Key in the Lock, and to get into the Garden over the Wall, where <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mille</hi> began to tune his Inſtrument at a diſtance, which done, he afterwards drew nearer and Sang: He had not proceeded far, when the Houſe door, that came into the Garden, was ſuddenly thruſt open; at which, <hi>Camille</hi> ſtep't aſide behind a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, preſently came out running with their Swords in hand, three perſons, very furiouſly, which made the good Father to make towards the place that he had come in at, where by the advantage of a Terrace walk, he nimbly got over the Wall into a back Street, and from thence immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly home. The purſuers finding the Garden door lock'd; they ſought up and down the Garden af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their prey, which gave time to <hi>Camille</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move his Station; he was paſſing croſs the walk, cloſe by the door of the Houſe; when a Woman taking him by the hand, come follow me, ſaid ſhe, I will put you out at the Street Door, and go along with you; though I am not ſo well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded now, as I would have been, had you but ſtay'd till to morrow night; with that ſhe led him out by the Street door, where ſhe thus continued to ſpeak.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:135663:248"/> are, and will be ſenſible of what I do for you; How that I abandon all other intereſts, to follow you; and now that I have put my ſelf into your hands, even before you could expect it, and when you did intend nothing more than a private viſit to me, I hope that you will deal generouſly by me, and faithfully perform all your vows and proteſtations to me; in order to which I deſire you to convey me preſently to your own houſe, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where elſe, if you think us not ſafe there from my Brothers ſearch after us, and there to Marry me out of hand; that being once done, you may claim me as your own, which will very much allay that proſecution, which otherwiſe we might expect with all the ſeverity imaginable from my incenſed Brothers. Having ſaid this, ſhe made a pauſe, as expecting his anſwer. Which hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not, what is the matter, continued ſhe, that you anſwer me not? Do you think me too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in this Juncture, or do you relent in your affections? ſaying this, ſhe held back
<hi>Camille,</hi> who was ſtill going a round pace, he knew not where; I will be ſatisfied continued ſhe, before I go a ſtep further. <hi>Camille</hi> then ſeeing a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of undeceiving that perſon, he led her towards the middle of the Street, where there was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more light, and lifting up his head, he gave her time and opportunity to ſee her miſtake, by looking in his Face. So ſoon as ſhe ſaw <hi>Camille,</hi> making a great ſhriek, ſhe endeavour'd to ſnatch her hand out of his, and would have gone from him; when <hi>Camille,</hi> finding that it was time for him to ſpeak, ſaid, Madam, be not ſo affrighted as you are; but aſſure your ſelf that you are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into the hands of a Gentleman, who though
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:135663:249"/> a ſtranger in theſe parts, will ſerve and protect you with his Life, from any danger whatſoever; be pleas'd but to recollect your ſelf a little, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, finding that ſhe did ſtill endeavour to get away; and caſt not your ſelf into unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inconveniencies by your needleſs apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; do but command me, let me but know what is moſt expedient that I ſhould do for you at preſent, and you will find, that I ſhall obey with all the reſpects and diligence imaginable. Theſe words being delivered by
<hi>Camille,</hi> with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and grace, which did ſpeak him what he was, did ſomewhat ſettle again the trembling Lady, who took the boldneſs to ſay, Sir, if in my late misfortune I have had ſo much happineſs as to fall into the hands of a Gentleman, that will not make uſe of the advantages that my miſtake and the darkneſs of the Night has given him; ſhew your ſelf ſuch, and immediately bring me back to that place, where I firſt did meet with you. That were not to ſerve you, replyed <hi>Camille,</hi> but rather to proſtitute you to your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy's Fury. Therefore, rather inform me, Madam, where I may convey you into the hands of that perſon, for whom you took me, who without queſtion will gladly receive you into his protection. If I am ſo happy, reply'd the Lady, as to have met with ſo generous a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; I ſhall be oblig'd to return my thanks to Heaven, for having ſent me, in ſuch an extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, ſo favourable an aſſiſtance, which I might not have expected from thoſe of my own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had I been ſo unfortunate as to have fallen in any of their Hands, with all theſe diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. You loſe time, Madam, reply'd <hi>Camille,</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:135663:249"/> and know not how ſoon you may be overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and ſurpriz'd; I have already declared to you, that I am not of this Nation, and I add to it, that though my lodgings are not far from this place, I neither know where I am at preſent, nor which way to retrieve them, and did I know, I ſhould not go about to do it, till I had left you ſafe, where you deſire to be; therefore I once more humbly intreat you, Madam, to guide me where you would have me to conduct you: You ſee, continued <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mille,</hi> that day begins to break, and ſhould you be found at this time of the night in the open Streets with a man, you may gueſs at the dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. I know not where to go, replyed the Lady, for I am ignorant of <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi>'s Houſe, therefore I muſt intreat you to lead me any where, till I have the opportunity to ſend to him to come to me. <hi>Camille</hi> was going to reply, when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a man coming in haſte towards them, who ſaid, Sir, if you are a Gentleman, pray aſſiſt me againſt the odds that my Enemies have over me; at this the Gentlewoman knowing by his voice that it was her Friend: Oh! my <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> cry'd ſhe, running towards him: Here is a Gentleman continued ſhe, looking on <hi>Camille,</hi> that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens have ſent on purpoſe to aſſiſt us. This did ſomewhat calm the jealous <hi>Spaniard.</hi> Who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to look ſourly upon that perſon, whom he had found in private with his Miſtreſs; but preſently the Ladies Brothers coming up, with their Swords drawn, they cryed here he is, which interrupted their further diſcourſe, by falling apon <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> which made <hi>Camille</hi> to draw likewiſe, and to aſſiſt the weakeſt ſide.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:135663:250"/>The claſhing of the Swords did preſently call ſome of the watch to them, before any hurt was done, which made every one ſhift for himſelf; by good fortune the Watch following the three Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they gave time to the others to get off. But they not finding the Lady where they had left her, nor no where there abouts, they went to ſearch a little further, where <hi>Camille</hi> found himſelf juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his own door, meeting there with Father
<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,</hi> who had the Lady by the hand; he being impatient at <hi>Camille</hi>'s abſence had gone out with a deſign to ſeek after him, and paſſing by juſt when they where fighting, and perceiving a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſtanding by, much affrighted, taking her to be the Marchioneſs, he had led her toward his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſhe being ſo ſurpriz'd at the ſight of her Brothers, had given her hand to the firſt comer, without conſidering who it was. They were all very glad to meet ſo luckily in that place: <hi>Alphonſo</hi> told <hi>Camille,</hi> that he was infinitely oblig'd to him for his generous aſſiſtance, without which he muſt doubtleſs have faln under the diſadvantage of his Enemies Swords. Sir, reply'd
<hi>Camille,</hi> this is no place to uſe compliments in, and I judge it dangerous for you both to appear any more in the Streets this Night, while your Brothers are yet in the purſuit of you. Neither would it be ſafe for us to retire to my Houſe yet, ſaid <hi>Alphonſo:</hi> You ſay right, anſwer'd <hi>Camille,</hi> therefore if you pleaſe to accept of what accommodation my Lodgings and the houſe will afford, you ſhall find there a hearty welcome, where you may remain ſafe, and as private as you pleaſe, till you have the leiſure and conveniency to retire your ſelf where elſe you ſhall think fit. <hi>Alphonſo</hi> having return'd
<hi>Camille</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:135663:250"/> humble thanks, turning to the Lady, Madam, ſaid he, ſince it is dangerous in having you any further this night, leaſt that you ſhould fall again into the hands of your Brothers, if you pleaſe, we will be further ingaged unto this gallant perſon, in accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his kind offers; at which the Lady made anſwer, I am willing to accept of this Gentlemans Civilities; but it ſhall be upon condition that you ſhall preſently ſend for a Prieſt to Marry us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the Lady; and you, Sir, continued ſhe, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing her ſelf to
<hi>Camille,</hi> you ſhall engage to me before I enter, that you will do me the favour to give me to this Gentleman; he knows what a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Fortune I bring along with me, in ſpight of my Brothers, able to re-eſtabliſh his broken For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; and when once my Brothers know that I am his by Marriage, they will lay aſide their anger, and deſiſt any further proſecutions.
<hi>Camille</hi> and <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi> having promis'd that ſhe ſhould have all the ſetisfaction that ſhe ſhould require; they went up Stairs, where, while the Prieſt was ſent for, and a Chamber getting ready for them, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mille</hi> gave them the beſt entertainment that he could; and an account of his Amours, and of the cauſe of all the diſorders of that Night through the Song, which he had applyed in a wrong place. After this,
<hi>Alphonſo</hi> and <hi>Camille</hi> renewed their Compliments, with aſſurances of ſervices on either ſide, and ſo they contracted a Friendſhip, which prov'd more durable than is uſual between a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> and an <hi>Italian;</hi> after a while the Prieſt being come, they were Married, and when they retired into that Chamber that had been fitted for them, where <hi>Camille</hi> having conducted them, he took
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:135663:251"/> his leave and left them, to go to his own Bed, and preſently after Father
<hi>Andrew</hi> did the like.</p>
                  <p>The next morning the good Father, who was always diligent in ſuch affairs, goes to the Marqueſs his Landlord again, and telling him he had been diſappointed by entangling the Key with other things in his Pocket, which pulling out, he had dropp'd and could not find again: That he deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to get another made; and giving the man a double Piſtol, to ſtop all replies and put offs, here is to pay for it, continued he, I ſhall come again in the Evening, therefore pray let it be ready againſt then: The Landlord was going to reply with a ſour Face, as if he did not like it, and had no mind to get another Key: But the cunning Father perceiving it: It may be that it will coſt more. Y'are in the right, continued he, and giving him another Piſtol, if that will not do, I will bring you more when I come to fetch it; at this the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord being overcome, he did promiſe him to get a Key ready againſt Evening.</p>
                  <p>By that time that Father <hi>Andrew</hi> was return'd, <hi>Alphonſo</hi> and his Lady were viſited by <hi>Camille,</hi> they deſired him to let them have a Meſſenger to ſend to
<hi>Alphonſo</hi>'s Houſe for ſome of his Servants to come to him; is was done accordingly; and <hi>Alphonſo</hi> having writ ſome Letters to ſome of his particular Friends, inviting them to come and accompany him and his Bride home; he ſent one of his own Servants with them, and ſent another home, to give order that all things ſhould be got in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs fit to receive him and his Friends; not long after, there came divers of the new married couples Friends to offer their Services: To whom <hi>Don Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo</hi> and his Lady returning thanks, they both
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:135663:251"/> recommended to their Friendſhip, <hi>Camille,</hi> and after the firſt uſual compliments were over, <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi> and his Bride, went, accompanied with a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number of Friends and Servants, in divers Coaches unto <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi>'s Houſe, where <hi>Camille</hi> and the good Father <hi>Andrew</hi> did attend them alſo; and towards the Evening, after they had been Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently treated, conſidering the little time to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare things in; having taken leave of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in general, they return'd home to prepare for the night expedition.</p>
                  <p>While Father <hi>Andrew</hi> was gone for the new Key, <hi>Camille</hi> employ'd himſelf in fitting anew his Theorbo, which had been diſorder'd in the late rancounter; it was not long before the diligent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther return'd, and a little after, it being time, they went out on the ſecond adventure. They ſoon did light on the right door, which Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> for fear of any further miſtakes, had mark'd with a piece of Chalk. Being entered and having ſhut the door upon them, for fear of any ſurprize from without; <hi>Camille</hi> having tun'd his Inſtrument, he Sung to it as follows.</p>

                  <p>No ſooner had <hi>Camille</hi> ended his Song, but he was inform'd from the Window that it was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and that he ſhould the next Day about E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening come the ſame way, where there ſhould a Servant wait on purpoſe to admit him, after this the Window was ſhut, and
<hi>Camille</hi> with Father <hi>Andrew</hi> retired with all the ſatisfaction imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Camille</hi> was very impatient till the hour was come to render the viſit to the beautiful Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He could not ſleep all night for thinking on it, which made him paſs it in framing a thouſand
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:135663:252"/> agreeable Ideas in his fancy, about the Charming entertainment; and he was in ſuch a Rapture all the day following at the thoughts of the pleaſures, which he was e're long to enjoy, that he could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eat nor drink, being ſo wholly poſſeſt with thoſe joys, which he already did reliſh in his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. At laſt did come the happy hour, he flyes unto his bliſs, being at the Garden door, where he leaves Father <hi>Andrew</hi> to return home, he is met by a Servant Maid, who does conduct him to the Camber, his paſſion is rais'd to ſuch a height, at each ſtep that he makes towards it, that he endeavours to ſuppreſs it with the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſome reverſe of Fortune, for fear that his exceſs ſhould tranſport him beyond himſelf; he arrives at laſt to the Chamber door, he enters, he perceives the Lady in an obſcure place at the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end of the Chamber, he runs towards her, flings himſelf at her feet, and with a voice that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd the tranſports of his Soul, he ſays, <hi>Madam, what honour do I receive in this your gracious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention to my humble deſires? My Soul is ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported at the ſingular favours which I now enjoy from your extream bounty, that I want words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my reſentments; let therefore my ſilence, my reſpects, and my moſt humble ſubmiſſion, ſpeak to you what my Tongue cannot utter. Beautiful Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs, behold at your Feet, continued he, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo wholly poſſeſt with admiration at your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, that it preſerves a heart from the reach of the reſt of your whole ſex, to offer it pure and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the ſhrine of your adorable beauty. I do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that I am moſt unworthy of the leaſt of your favour, Madam, when I conſider that</hi> — Here he was interrupted by the Ladies riſing from
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:135663:253"/> her ſeat, who ſtepping towards the light, did look upon <hi>Camille</hi> with an eye full of indignation and revenge, which made <hi>Camille</hi> preſently perceive his error, and that all that he had ſaid, had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to <hi>Donna Barbara Dayamonte,</hi> in lieu of the Marchioneſs. He riſes, and being ſtruck dumb, he remains as motionleſs as a Statue, which gave time to <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> to expreſs her reſentments after this manner. <hi>Thou the moſt ungrateful, and the unworthieſt of all men; have I abandoned my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the cenſure of the whole world? have I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken an Husband, and all other intereſts, to come after thee? and is it thus that thou requiteſt me? I will be reveng'd: and ſince that I cannot by any means imaginable enjoy thy Life, I will be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of thy Death: Yes, Traytor, I will immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſend for the Marqueſs, whom thou haſt ſo abus'd, that in my preſence he may take a full revenge of thee, that my Eyes and my Heart may have the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of ſeeing thee periſh before me.</hi> With that ſhe commands aloud that the door ſhould be lock'd without ſide, which was preſently done within <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mille's</hi> hearing, after which ſhe continued to vent her rage againſt him, with ſuch paſſionate words, that poor <hi>Camille</hi> was never ſo amaz'd at any thing in all his Life, and of truth it did concern him; he found himſelf in the power, and at the mercy of an incenſed woman, who doubtleſs would give a full ſcope to all her reſentments, and ſatisfie her ſplenetick revenge at his coſt; there was no retreating; to offer to make his way back by force, were to oblige her the ſooner to call for help; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which the Marqueſs would not be forgot: To remain there without giving her ſome kind of ſatisfaction, were but to exaſperate her the more.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:135663:253"/> After divers debates within himſelf, concerning what he ſhould do, he reſolves to appeaſe her in ſome meaſure with kind words, fair promiſes, and humble ſubmiſſions, thereby to regain his liberty. In this deſign he approches the Bed whereon ſhe had thrown her ſelf, and bowing down: Madam, ſaid he, I muſt confeſs that my ſurprizal has been ſo great to find you here, when I thought you to be at <hi>Barcellona,</hi> that I am not yet able through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to recollect my ſelf; and I find that ſome time muſt be allowed me for it, which I humbly beg for, mean time all that I have to ſay for my ſelf, is, that believing that you had been ſo fully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by your Husband in your deſigns, and I having receiv'd orders from him never to return to <hi>Barcellona</hi> upon pain of Death, this had made me wholly give over all future hopes of ever hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the happineſs of ſeeing you again; and on the other hand, had brought me here in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the Marchioneſs, to renew with her my former affections, and if — Here <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> interrupted him, ſaying: But here I am, where in ſpight of all oppoſitions, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all dangers, and treading all other conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions under feet; I am come in purſuit of the moſt ungrateful of men; but if I muſt periſh, I will firſt break your meaſures, and have the ſatisfaction to ſee my Rival depriv'd of all hopes of poſſeſſing that which is refus'd unto my affections. Madam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>Camille,</hi> I am ſenſible of the infinite obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations that I owe you; and if you but pleaſe to allow me ſome ſmall time to wean my ſelf from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further thoughts on the Marchioneſs, I ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge what you have done for me, with all the reſpects and gratitude imaginable; and if you
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:135663:254"/> will have ſo much bounty, as to attribute my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer actions unto the exceſs of a blind paſſion, which made me pay to another, that which was with more Juſtice due to you, I ſhall for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture addreſs my vows here only, and limit my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs within the compaſs of that eſteem which you are pleas'd to expreſs for me; though ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of that happineſs. At this turn, <hi>Donna Barbara</hi> look'd up, and holding forth her hand, he took it, and kiſſed it; he found that ſhe would have him to help her up by it, which he did; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, they having had ſome further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, in order to a more ample reconciliation, and better underſtanding for the future, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas'd her Priſoner, upon condition, that he ſhould daily viſit her, the ſame way as he had done that Evening, until they were reſolv'd upon ſome courſe, to free themſelves abſolutely from all the Governour's purſuits, and to get out of his power. All which <hi>Camille</hi> having promiſed to perform, he took his leave of her, and returned home.</p>
                  <p>Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> very impatient to learn what ſucceſs <hi>Camille</hi> had had, did no ſooner ſee him, but with a chearful countenance, he inquired how the Marchioneſs had entertain'd him; but when <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mille</hi> had inform'd him of the miſtake, the good Father's looks did ſo viſibly change, that no body would have took him for the ſame man; yet after ſome little pawſe that the amazement had caus'd; <hi>Well, Sir,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>what is done cannot be help'd, but to prevent further troubles, let us make what diligence we can to find out the right Marchioneſs, and to ſee what may be done with her, before you are oblig'd to pay any further reſpects to</hi> Donna Barbara, <hi>to that purpoſe I will viſit all the Churches
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:135663:254"/> in the City, but I will find out the Marqueſs, or at leaſt meet with ſome body that will inform me of him:</hi> This being concluded on, they went to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and from thence to Bed, where <hi>Camille</hi> had full leiſure to reflect on the oddneſs of this laſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, and of the means to prevent further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveniences, for which he thought no way better than a quick diſpatch, in getting the Marchioneſs at liberty.</p>
                  <p>In the morning Father <hi>Andrew</hi> goes to the great Church, where after ſome time he ſees the Marqueſs come in; he waits behind a Pillar, till he had finiſh'd his devotions, and then traces him home, and now what's to be done, but to return to <hi>Camille,</hi> and give him an account of the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and conſult together, how to inform ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily the Marchioneſs of their being at <hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> becauſe that otherways <hi>Donna Barbara</hi>'s expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from <hi>Camille</hi> might ſpoil all, if not anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red according to her deſires. After ſome time ſpent in debates, it is concluded that the good Father ſhould be diſguis'd like one of thoſe women which go from Houſe to Houſe in thoſe Countries, ſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Womens little Trinkets; for there, they have not the great conveniency of three Exchanges, to pick and chuſe in, leaſt they ſhould make choice of ſuch ware, as their Husbands would be very unwilling to pay for. No ſooner concluded but executed, and while the one is dreſſing up like a very neat old Woman, to which the withered beardleſs Face, did not a little contribute, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was writing a Note which was to be ſecretly convey'd to the Marchioneſs. The Father it fitted with all neceſſaries, the Note is convey'd very ſmooth into a Glove, and the brisk old Woman,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:135663:255"/> being in a perfect readineſs, goes to the Marqueſs Houſe: She meets with a Servant, of whom ſhe inquires if ſhe can be admitted with her Ware to the Marchioneſs.
<hi>I have ſuch choice of curious things,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>as I am ſure will pleaſe her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well. At this time ſhe is not to be ſpoken with,</hi> replyed the Servant. <hi>That is, becauſe that ſhe knows not what excellent things I bring,</hi> replyed the old Woman: <hi>but if ſhe did, I ſhould not be here ſo long without being call'd in; I tell you,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the Servant, <hi>that ſhe is now buſie, that the Marqueſs is at preſent with her, in her Chamber, and that therefore you muſt come again ſome other time.</hi> At the word Marqueſs the good old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was willing to be ſatisfied, to return, and to let the buſineſs alone till ſome other time, when that bugbear were not in the way. In this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution ſhe begins to retire, when the Marqueſs coming by from his Wife's Chamber, he inquires what that Woman would have. It was now time to put on a good Face, nothing but the height of confidence with a good courage can carry off the old Woman, therefore ſhe briskly anſwers; that ſhe was come to ſhew the Marchioneſs ſome choice things, which ſhe hop'd would pleaſe her, that if he pleas'd to order that ſhe might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ſhe was confident, that ſhe ſhould give the Lady full content. The Marqueſs, who ever ſince the Pilgrim's laſt ſeiſure, had been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more complaiſant to the Marchioneſs than before, had a mind to give his Wife ſome little preſent, out of this Womans ſtore; he therefore turning back again, ſaid, Come follow me: At the word, follow, our old Woman did look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her plot as been utterly ſpoil'd, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:135663:255"/> not ſo much as once to mention the Gloves wherein lay the Letter, nor to let them be ſeen. The Marqueſs enters his Wife's Chamber, and tells her that he had brought her a woman with ſome things, of which he would have her make choice. The Marchioneſs, who was then ſomewhat out of humour, at the news of the Pilgrim's ſecond impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, told him that ſhe needed nothing for the preſent, and that ſhe ſhould call ſome other time: The old Woman, who thought there could be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done ſo long as the troubleſome Marqueſs was preſent, was very willing to retire, fearing very much a diſcovery; but the Marqueſs holding her back, ſaid, Nay, but I have a mind to preſent you with ſomething; and taking the Woman by the arm, he pulls her to the Table, and ſhuts the door of the Chamber, bidding her lay open her Ware: The old Woman would have given all her Shop, Cloaths, and a finger to boot, had ſhe been quit for that, to have been in <hi>Camille</hi>'s Chamber, but all the wiſhes in the world will not do, ſhe was got in too far to retire; and now ſhe muſt make ſomething of it, or be loſt for ever; In this extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity ſhe diſplays her Merchandiſe; the Marqueſs preſently ranſacks in it, and bids his Wife to chuſe what ſhe lik'd beſt: She with a great indifferency, meerly to pleaſe him, takes what comes next to her hand, the Marqueſs not pleas'd at it, does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage her to look on all, and take what ſhe lik'd beſt; and with that toſſes and tumbles the whole pack from top to bottom: The old Woman had her Eye continually upon the tell-tale Glove, and ſtill as it came uppermoſt, was very diligent to change its Station, and remove it a form lower; but at laſt the Marqueſs Eyes it, and finding it to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:135663:256"/> his mind, takes hold of it at one end, while the old Woman preſently ſeizes on the other, the Marqueſs pulls it, the old Woman holds it faſt, and to get it again out of the Marqueſs his hands, ſhe gives him the other Glove, telling him, that that which he had, had ſome fault in it, which ſhould be mended if the other did fit, which ſhe would try; with that the Marqueſs lets go his hold, and is ſo officious, that he will pull himſelf the other Glove on his Wife's hand, mean time the old Woman fumbles about the other, not daring to venture the pulling out of the paper, for fear of the Marqueſs's prying Eyes. The Marqueſs hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pull'd on that Glove, which fitted and look'd very well, he asks for the other; the old Woman having no other way left to get off, preſently takes the Marchioneſſes hand, to pull it on her ſelf, the Marqueſs will have the office on 't, ſhe perſiſts in her will, and gets it on the Marchioneſſes hand, do the Marqueſs what he could to oppoſe her; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhe was aſham'd to ſtand ſtill and ſee the Marqueſs thus take her work out of her hand, which oblig'd the Marqueſs to deſiſt, though grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blingly, and diſpleas'd at the over diligent old Womans oppoſition; ſhe mean time pulls on the Glove, though not with ſo much diligence and neatneſs, as had the Marqueſs, ſhe buſying her ſelf at the ſame time, in preſſing the Marchioneſſes El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow with her hand, and guiding her Fingers to the Paper; the Marqueſs ſtood looking on with the greateſt impatiency in the World, having not power to deſiſt any longer from ſhewing his dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, and abhorring the old Womans bungling, juſt as the Marchioneſs was ſenſible that there was ſomething more than ordinary in that Glove, the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:135663:256"/> Marqueſs takes the old Woman by the arm, and very angrily he turns her away, to take her em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment from her; at which the Marchioneſs giving a ſhriek, Cry'd,
<hi>You have ſtrain'd my Wriſt;</hi> with that, holding her other hand with her Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief over her Glove and Wriſt, ſhe put by the over officious Marqueſs, telling him that ſhe would not have it touch'd till the anguiſh was over. This put the Marqueſs quite out of humour, who fell a grumbling at the old Woman, while that his Wife having bid one of her Servants to carry thoſe things which ſhe had choſen, into her Cloſet, ſhe followed her to lay them up; ſo ſoon as the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had laid them down, ſhe ſent her back for to know what they came to, and to ask of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man if ſhe had not ſome Eſſences, mean time ſhe takes out the Paper in which ſhe read.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Your Pilgrims Agent, here demands,</l>

                  </q>
                  <p>And having found a ſhort piece of Black-lead Pencel, in one of the Fingers, ſo ſoon as ſhe had ſent the Woman of another errand, while her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was paying the old Woman, ſhe writ on the other ſide of the paper,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This Night, in the Garden, under my Cloſet Window;</hi> and having conveyed it into the Glove again, ſhe unripp'd ſome ſeams between the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and gave it the old Woman, telling her, that ſhe ſhould get it mended; the Marqueſs was going to lay hands on it again, but the old Woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too nimble for him, thruſt it into her pack a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt her other things, ſaying, that ſhe would bring it again ſometime that day, or the next

                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:135663:257"/> fartheſt, and taking leave ſhe was going off, when the Marqueſs ſeizing her by the Hand, and pulling her back again, did give her and his Wife a freſh allarm, but it laſted not long; for the buſy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs did ſoon put them out of it, in bidding the old Woman to leave the money which ſhe had receiv'd for the Gloves, till ſhe came again, the money be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing readily render'd by the good Woman, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently went her way, with an aſſurance of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again with the Glove mended to their like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>The good Father <hi>Andrew</hi> being got off thus, with flying Colours, was ſo puff'd up with good ſucceſs, that he thought nothing could be above his atchievement, he was ſo prepoſſeſt with that good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of himſelf, that going out of the Chamber, in lieu of taking his leave after the manner of the Matrons, he was for bowing forwards with his hands a croſs, in a Fryar-like Salutation; but rectifying himſelf, before notice was taken, he got off with credit, and was not long before he return'd to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mille;</hi> where in giving him a full account of his good ſucceſs, he was not wanting in expreſſing the Marqueſs's over-diligence, and to trumpet forth his own praiſes in his dexterous avoiding of all the Husband's troubleſome pryings into the myſterious part of the late contrivance; and giving the Glove to <hi>Camille,</hi> he found in it what the Marchioneſs had writ.</p>
                  <p>Buſineſs being brought to that paſs with the Marchioneſs, <hi>Camille</hi>'s next care was to pacify ſtill more and more <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> and ſo prevent her from ſpoiling his deſigns, which ſhe might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily do, but with one word writing to the Marqueſs; if ſhe had but the leaſt ſuſpicion imaginable of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mille's,</hi>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:135663:257"/> correſpondency with her Rival. This made him, ſo ſoon as it was Evening, to render her a viſit. She receiv'd it very kindly, and they were enter'd upon a very amorous entertainment, when the Maid came running into the Chamber, and as well as her fright and haſt would permit her, ſhe told them, that there was a Perſon of quality at the Street-door, that was ſetting a Guard upon it; after that he had done the ſame at the back-door, with a charge to let no body go out of the houſe, on what account ſoever, without his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther orders. Preſently people were heard to come up ſtairs, which made her to run out of the Chamber again, and to lock the door after her; one ask'd aloud which was the Chamber, which being told, and finding it ſhut, it was broke open; yet not ſo ſuddenly, but that <hi>Donna Barbara,</hi> had time to convey <hi>Camille</hi> into her Cloſet, where he reſting on his knees and hands, ſhe ſpread a Carpet over him, and gently ſeating her ſelf upon him, as on a ſtool, in that poſture ſhe waited (with the Cloſet door open, that ſhe might the ſooner be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd) till thoſe perſons were enter'd her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                  <p>The Door being broken down, in ruſhes the Governour of <hi>Barcellona:</hi> After he had left two Servants to guard the Chamber door, with a ſtrict charge to let no body go out of it. So ſoon as the Governour had eſpy'd his Wife, he cry'd out, <hi>Oh! are you there, Madam?</hi> I
<hi>muſt find out your Minion alſo, if he is here, that I may pay him my reſpects:</hi> This ſaid, he ſearch'd all over the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Cloſet, flinging the Bed and Bedding all over the Room, and leaving not one hole or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner unviſited, not ſo much as a Window, or the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:135663:258"/> Chimney eſcaping him; but having not found what he ſought after, he returns to his Wife, and taking her off of her ſeat: <hi>Come, Madam, ſince I am ſo unfortunate not to meet with your devout Pilgrim, give me leave in his abſence to ſupply his office, and to lead you into ſome place more ſecure, than you find this to be:</hi> With that he leads her out, giving a ſpecial care to the Servants to watch the Door till his return, and to let no body in; then he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys her into a Coach, and from thence into a Nunnery, where he left her in the Care of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs, who was a Kinſwoman of his Wifes.</p>
                  <p>He was returning to his Wifes Lodgings, to pack up all that ſhe had left there, when he eſpy'd the Marqueſs that ſtood at his Gardens back Door, they would willingly have ſhunn'd one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but not being able to avoid their approaches, they were forc'd to Salute: The Marqueſs was very much ſurpriz'd to ſee the Governour of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellona</hi> at
<hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> where, when he came firſt himſelf, he did not deſign to ſtay above five or ſix days, only to view the City. The Marqueſs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given the Governour, an account of his Wifes Health, and enquired of his and his Ladies, the Governour gave him a brief account of her late e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape from him, which had made him to ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her there, where he had found her, but not the wicked Pilgrim, who he verily believ'd had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd her; at which the Marqueſs ſmiling, made anſwer, that he had done that work for him three days ſince, and that he had ſent him to Priſon, where he was ſafe enough. They finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Companions in the ſame affliction, though there were great odds; and that their Wive's zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous devotions to the holy Pilgrim, could not be-allay'd
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:135663:258"/> ſo eaſily, the Marqueſs was invited by the Covernour, to go with him to his Wife's late Lodgings, where he was to return, that they might paſs away the reſidue of the Evening together, and conſult how to reſcue their Wives, for the future, from that Deviliſh Pilgrims temptations. The Governour did prevail, and took Coach to that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The Governour return'd with the Marqueſs to his Wife's Lodgings. They were not long before they fell into a very ſerious diſcourſe of their Wives; and amongſt other things, the Marqueſs was ſaying, that if ever that Pilgrim ſhould get out of Priſon again, he would certainly be the ruin of them both, to their own ſhame and confuſion: That therefore they were ſo to order the buſineſs, as to have him condemn'd and executed, which would be a certain way to be for ever rid of him; all this was in the hearing of <hi>Camille,</hi> with divers other things and contrivances, in which they did ſpend a conſiderable time.</p>
                  <p>Mean while, diligent Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> who was always upon the watch, having had an account of all that had paſs'd, and not hearing a word menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd of <hi>Camille,</hi> who was not return'd to his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, he concluded that he had hid himſelf in <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Barbara</hi>'s Chamber, whence he durſt not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture forth, ſo long as the Governour ſhould be there; he ponders within himſelf, what he had beſt to do for his deliverance, before the time of the Night were come, that they were to repair un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Marchioneſſes Window in the Garden; he returns to his Lodgings the better to contrive the buſineſs. A little after there came a Meſſenger from the Priſon, with a Letter directed to the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:135663:259"/> Marchioneſs, without a name, lodging in ſuch a Street. When the Marqueſs had caus'd the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim to be committed, he had given charge, that in caſe the Priſoner ſhould deſire Pen and Ink, that it ſhould be granted to him, but that whatſoever he ſhould write to be ſent forth, ſhould be immediatly brought to him: This had been done accordingly; but the Meſſenger being at the Marqueſs's Houſe, had been ſent here after him. The Marqueſs having receiv'd it, open'd it, and read as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>

                  <p>This Letter being read, the Marqueſs and the Governour could not but admire at once, both the ſimplicity and impudence of this Pilgrim; yet the Governour did take notice, that this was not writ

                  <p>This laſt Letter did ſo ſurprize them both, that looking on one another, they remain'd mute; at laſt the Governour ſaid, that they ought not to let ſlip ſo fair an opportunity, of puniſhing their Wive's diligent Mercury. No, no, reply d the Marqueſs, that would be a great overſight, I will immediately go to the Priſon and have him ſeiz'd on, and I will along with you, ſaid the Governour; for I long to ſee how ſtrangely he will be ſurpriz'd at the ſight of us: Thus you ſee, reply'd the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, that the wicked ſeek their own ruin, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:135663:260"/> bring themſelves to receive the puniſhment due to their offences. Well, reply'd the Governour, now is the time to ſecure both theſe wicked men, that they ſhall never more be in any Capacity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauching our Wives. Let's be going, reply'd the Marqueſs, and loſe no time, for fear he be gone before we come, and that we loſe this fair opportunity of ſeizing him: with that they did immediately take Coach to the other end of the City, where was the Priſon.</p>
                  <p>They were no ſooner got out of the Houſe, but the politick Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> of whoſe contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Letter was, came in, he goes up Stairs, and having ask d which was the Chamber that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to the Governour of <hi>Barcellona;</hi> it was ſhew'd him by one of the Guards, he draws near it, and is repulſed, and told, that no body was to go in there: I know, replyed the ſubtle Father, that your Orders are to let no body in, but you are not hindred from letting any Perſon go out, eſpecially when I am ſent on purpoſe by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour for them. There is no body there, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd one of the Servants; It were ſtrange indeed, reply'd the Father, then they are gone out before I came for them, and yet I have made what haſte I could from the Governour and the Marqueſs; I came here directly, and have not met by the way that Perſon that I come for: But I loſe time, and the buſineſs preſſes. <hi>Signiour</hi> Camille, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he with a loud Voice, <hi>you muſt leave off your watching, for he that you wait for has been a Priſoner theſe three days, and you muſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately go along with me to the Governour, that ſtays for you; come forth and I will deliver you my Errand punctually:</hi> This was ſpoken with ſo
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:135663:260"/> much confidence by the Fryar, that the Servants preſently open'd the Door, and forth came <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mille; Now, Sir,</hi> continued Father <hi>Andrew, I muſt tell you that there is one Father</hi> Andrew <hi>at the Priſon, that would ſpeak with the Pilgrim Priſoner; the Governour was going to ſeize on him, but he has better conſider'd on't, and therefore has ſent me for you, that you ſhould go firſt, and bring him certain word, whether it be that Perſon that he means, or not, whom he ſays you know very well.</hi> This did the good Father ſpeak with ſo much readineſs, that <hi>Camille</hi> himſelf was ſtartled at it; and the Servants having heard the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and the Marqueſs diſcourſe of it, before they went forth, they made no ſcruple in the leaſt to let him go: <hi>Camille</hi> and the Fryar got home to their Lodgings, where they had leiſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect themſelves, to laugh at their Cullies Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulities, and to prepare againſt the time of going under the Marchioneſſes Window.</p>
                  <p>Mean time the Governour and the Marqueſs are carried with all the diligence poſſible unto the Priſon, contriving all the way how to puniſh this wicked and moſt abominable Fryar; at laſt they get thither, and preſently inquire of the Keeper where was the Fryar. What Fryar do you mean, reply'd the Keeper? Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> Father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,</hi> reply'd the Marqueſs haſtily; I hope you have not let him go, continued he? Never talk of that, ſaid the Governour, where is he, where is he? What have you done with him? ſaid the Marqueſs. The Keeper amaz'd at their earneſt inquiries, ſtood ſtaring ſometime on one, ſometime on the other, without ſaying a word. Pray, ſays the Governour to him, convey us where he is, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:135663:261"/> if you can, ſo as that we may ſee him without diſcovering our ſelves: Nay, it were much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, now I think on't, ſaid the Marqueſs, to place us ſo as that we might hear him diſcourſe with the Pilgrim, and not be ſeen. Doubtleſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the Governour, but we ſhould make ſome notable diſcoveries, and therefore go let him into the Pilgrim, while we ſtay here till you come back to lead us where we may hear them. Let it be as of your own accord, ſaid the Marqueſs, and be quick, for I long to hear what new piece of Villany they are conſulting of; at this they both pauſing a while, wondring that the Keeper did not ſtir, he had time to ſay, I aſſure you, My Lord, that you have both ſo ſurpriz'd me, I know not what to think, much leſs what to ſay; neither do I ſcarce know where, or who I am; I have heard you all this while, ſpeak of a Fryar and a Pilgrim, but I know no more what you mean by it, than the Man in the Moon. Then rubbing of his Eyes, and yawning, Let me ſee, continued he, am I aſleep ſtill, or do I wake? Though I was ſleeping when you came, certainly I am now awake, or how ſhould I ſtand thus elſe, continued he ſtrutting, and ſpeak thus to you; nay, ſee and hear you too? And yet I do proteſt to you, that I know nothing at all of any Fryars being here: At this the Marqueſs ſhew'd him the Letter, and ſaid, did you not ſend me this Letter, about half an hour ſince? Who I, ſend a Letter, reply'd the Keeper? <hi>I</hi> was then dreaming of other things, <hi>I</hi> can aſſure you, continued he; and <hi>I</hi> have neither writ, ſent, or ſo much as thought of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, this day, except that which <hi>I</hi> ſent you from the Pilgrim a while ſince; then looking on the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:135663:261"/> Letter, which the Marqueſs had given him; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this my hand writing, alas! <hi>I</hi> could never write a quarter ſo well: This the Keepers ſtory, made the Marqueſs and the Governour, in their turn to be mute, and look on one another; they concluded that this had been ſome trick of their Wives, not without ſome deſigns: As for mine, ſaid the Governour, ſhe is at preſent ſafe enough from doing any miſchief of that nature: And mine, ſaid the Marqueſs, has not had a Pen and Ink ſince <hi>I</hi> have Married her, except the Devil has ſupply'd her with one of late; <hi>I</hi> rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that it is that curſed Fryar himſelf, that has thus ſham'd us: But to what purpoſe, reply'd the Governour? To nothing that is good, you may be certain, anſwered the Marqueſs; and for my part <hi>I</hi> will haſten home, where <hi>I</hi> think my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence more neceſſary than here; with that they took leave of one another, and went each to their own home.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as the Governour was return'd, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd of his Servants who had been there, they anſwered him, no body, but the little ancient Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman whom he had ſent to fetch the other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, that had been left in the Chamber to watch for the Pilgrim. How, ſaid the Governour, a man left in the Chamber to watch for the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim? How? ſaid the Governour, a man left in the Chamber, and now gone out, while you two ſtand at the Door and permit it? With that drawing his Sword, You Villains, continued he, I'll be the death of you both; how many were there to force him from you? What reſiſtance have you made? And if you were over-power'd, ſhew me your wounds? Where is the blood that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:135663:262"/> you have ſpill'd in making oppoſition? At theſe high words, both the poor Fellows, falling on their knees, gave him an exact account of the whole paſſage, and with tears in their Eyes, ask'd him pardon for their Errour. The Governour preſently enter'd the Chamber, and while he was conſidering where this perſon could be hid, he was thinking alſo who it ſhould be; at laſt, he concluded that there was ſome great miſtake in the buſineſs, and did believe that the Marqueſs had lighted on the wrong Pilgrim, who he had ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, while the damn'd right one had been hid in his Wives Chamber, whence his ſpecial agent, that wicked Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> had got him out by framing of that Letter: This did ſet him in ſuch a rage, that he would not ſo much as give the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs an account of his thoughts, which he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be certain; but the next morning early he went to the Monaſtery, whence having taken out his Wife, he return'd with her to <hi>Barcellona,</hi> where he us'd her as he pleas'd.</p>
                  <p>The Marqueſs, all this while, had not been wanting in diligently inquiring of all the Servants, who had been there, and examing of the two Guardian Women, ſo tormenting them, that one of them nam'd <hi>Zora,</hi> being tyred out with his fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous repeated queſtions, and fretting at his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable threatning of them, for letting his Wife have the conveniency of writing, ſhe knowing her ſelf innocent, did at laſt tell the Marqueſs, that there was no Hell, like living with a Man ſo ſtrangely jealous as he was, which did ſet the Marqueſs in ſuch a fury, that he ſtruck her, which made her run into the Marchioneſſes Chamber with Tears in her Eyes: The Marchioneſs ask'd what
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:135663:262"/> was the matter, to which <hi>Zora</hi> anſwered; That, Madam, which in a ſhort time ſhall turn to your advantage. The Marchioneſs who had deſign'd to ſit up till the Marqueſs was return'd, leaſt that he going his uſual rounds before going to Bed, ſhould meet with the Letter, which his Wife did intend for <hi>Camille;</hi> hearing that the Marqueſs was coming to Bed, ſhe went and dropp'd the Letter, ſo retiring, ſhe put her ſelf in Bed; while the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs was undreſſing he did nothing but grumble, fret, and threaten, in a word, the falſe Letter had ſet him quite out of humour.</p>
                  <p>The hour come, which was about the darkeſt part of the Night, <hi>Camille</hi> got over the Wall with the active Father <hi>Andrew</hi> into the Garden; for though the good Father had no great buſineſs there, yet he lov'd ſo well the ſport, that <hi>Camille</hi> could not prevail with him to ſtay at home: They were not got half way the walk, which led from the Garden Door to the Houſe, when Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> whoſe Eyes were always upon the watch, did perceive ſomething that mov'd at the other end; this put him to a ſtand, and made him take
<hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mille</hi> by the arm, and hold him back: Stay, ſaid he, I think I ſee ſome body that is waiting for us, let us retire while we can, for fear of a ſurprize: <hi>Camille</hi> looking earneſtly alſo, ſaid, I do ſee ſomething move, but it is not tall enough to be a man, and I rather believe that it is ſome Dog, which though not ſo dangerous, may, I fear diſcover us, and ſpoil our deſign. Father <hi>Andrew</hi> was for a retreat, and <hi>Camille</hi> was leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the broad Walk, and ſtriking into the leſſer Allies to go round by the Wall ſide to diſcover what it were, without being perceiv'd; but the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:135663:263"/> good Father having no inclination to venture any further, ſaid, that he was ſure it was no Dog, and that he would ſtay under the next Tree, while <hi>Camille</hi> ſhould go make the diſcovery. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mille</hi> agreed to it, and went by the Wall ſide till he came near enough to diſtinguiſh that it was a Monkey that had broke loſe from ſome of the Neighbourhood, who having found the Letter that the Marchioneſs had thrown there, he had torn it open, and was playing with it. <hi>Camille</hi> was glad that it was no worſe, yet knew not which way to go about to get the Letter from that little unlucky Creature; he was ſtill drawing nearer to him, when the Monkey did perceive him, which made him chatter ſo faſt and ſo loud, all the while tearing of the Letter, that <hi>Camille</hi> thought there was no time to loſe, therefore he ſuddenly ruſh'd upon the Monkey, who being too nimble for him, did run away, ſqueeking ſo loud that the Marqueſs being alarm'd at it, did preſently get to the Window, with a Piſtol in his hand, and perceiving <hi>Camille,</hi> who was very buſie in gathering up the pieces of Paper, that the Monkey had ſcatter'd, he diſcharg'd it at him, but to no effect.</p>
                  <p>Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> at the noiſe of the Piſtol, did run as faſt as he could towards the place where they had left the Ladder of Ropes hanging, by which they had got over, but meeting by chance with the Monkey, which he took for a Man, his fears magnifying all objects, he ran counter, and knowing no better way, finding himſelf near a high Tree, he preſently climbs to the top of it, where he hid himſelf amongſt the thickeſt of the Leaved Branches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:135663:263"/>
                     <hi>Camille</hi> having gathered all that he could find of the Pieces of Paper, made what haſte he could towards the place of retreat, and not ſeeing Father
<hi>Andrew,</hi> as he paſs'd by, he concluded that he was gone, which made him to follow after. By this the Marqueſs and his Servants were got into the Garden, with Guns, Piſtols, Swords, and other Weapons, they ſearch every Buſh, Hedge, and Corner, but find no body, the Marqueſs ſees a piece of Paper lying upon the ground, he takes it up, and puts it into his Pocket to peruſe ſome other time; he was too buſie then, neither had he light enough to do it. Some run to the back Gate, which is found ſhut, they perceive ſome Morter and Stones newly dropp'd from the Wall which made them conclude that they were Thieves gone that way out, ſo that they were all returning in.</p>
                  <p>As the Marqueſs was paſſing under a Tree, he was hit on the Hat with a piece of withered Branch, at which he preſently looks up, and perceives ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to move; he rejoices within himſelf alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that he had found the Robbers of his Honour, and commands ſome of his Servants to get up, and fetch them down, dead or alive. While he was pondering what Torments and Racks he ſhould make them endure, ſome of the Servants being got up, they heard a ſtrange chattering, for the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky who had cauſed the dryed bough to fall, finding himſelf purſued ſo cloſe, made ſuch a noiſe as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently gave to underſtand to his purſuers the Nature of the Beaſt. But the Marqueſs's diſtruſtful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, making him ſuſpect that it might be ſome Counterfeit, he commanded his Servants to purſue and take him. The unlucky nimble Creature, having no other way to avoid his purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:135663:264"/> he leaps from the Tree he was on to the next, where ſat the moſt diſtreſſed Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> whom the fooliſh Creature taking to be one of his Enemies, he began to ſqueek and chatter more than ever: Thoſe that were upon the abandon'd Tree having given notice of their Preys removal; the Marqueſs ſent ſome up the other Tree, on which both the delinquents were retreated; one of the climbers went ſo high after this little troubleſome Animal, that he perceiv'd a certain pair of Legs, that did not belong unto ſo ſmall a Beaſt as a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key. The poor Father now perceiving that he was diſcovered paſt all hopes of Redemption, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending his caſe to all the He and She Saints, beſides the Eleven thouſand Virgins; when his fierce Enemy cry'd, <hi>Oh! have I found you out? I'll fetch you down preſently:</hi> This dreadful threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning did ſet him into ſuch an horror and fear, that it caus'd him to drop down ſomething, which his anguiſh would not let him retain any longer, juſt in the nick of time when the fellow was gaping and looking up; which did light ſo full upon his Face, that it ſtopt his Mouth from telling any more tales for that bout; and blinded him ſo, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to clear his Eyes with his Hands, he was ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate as to let go his hold, which made him fall to the ground, whence he was carried away ſpeechleſs. This ſad accident put an end to the Chace; for the Marqueſs thinking that there was too much miſchief done already, in the purſuit of a Monkey, did give order to all his Servants to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and let the Beaſt alone, which they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obey'd, taking the dead along with them.</p>
                  <p>Father <hi>Andrew</hi> having overheard the ſad acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that had been the cauſe of his ſad and ſafe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:135663:264"/> deliverance; after he had return'd thanks to all his Advocates, (though he thought his own induſtry very inſtrumental in it, which made him ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to rely very much on his own merits) finding the Coaſt clear, he comes down the Tree, and goes toward the place, by which he had come in, whereon he was looking very melancholick, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no hopes of getting out of the Garden, when he perceives a head peeping over the Wall: at the firſt his fears were going to make him to run to his old poſt again; but preſently recollecting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he thought that it could not be any one of the Houſe; becauſe that whoever did look over the Wall, muſt be in the Street: A little after he perceiv'd it was <hi>Camille;</hi> who having not found him at home, was return'd with the Ladder of Ropes to get him off, if he was not taken. The poor Father did preſently get over, and without ſpeaking on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>THE news of your double deliverance, has been no leſs welcome to me, than the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of your continuing in the generous reſolution of aſſiſting a poor afflicted Woman, wherein you expreſs ſo much Charity, as ſets you right in my Opinion, in ſpight of all that had been laid to your charge; ſome new Viſions which my Husband has had, ſince the induſtrious old Woman was here, has ſo chang'd that fortunate good humour that he was in then, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a furious malice againſt me; that by ſome words which the exceſs of his paſſion drives forth, I have
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:135663:265"/> ſome Jealouſies that he may attempt ſomething on my Life, or at leaſt remove me very ſpeedily, where I ſhall be miſerably mew'd up for the reſt of my days, without any future hopes of a deliverance; I have no way to divert this ſudden and dangerous ſtorm from falling on me, but by ſheltring my ſelf under the pretence of a fit of ſickneſs, which may retard his deſigns, till you have leiſure and conveniency to work my Liberty. I wiſh you could find a way to play the Phyſician as well as I ſhall act the Patients part, then I ſhould hope that my freedom were at hand, and then you might with juſtice expect from me a reward ſutable to your Signal Services, which could be no leſs, than all that I am able to diſpoſe of, without any prejudice to my honour and to vertue.

                  <p>When <hi>Camille</hi> came to that word, Endeavour, which intimated, by the abrupt breaking off, that there was ſomething wanting of the Letter; which he having left behind, had doubtleſs fallen into the Marqueſs his hands; that joy, which had been ſcrew'd up almoſt to an exceſs, by every Character of the Letter, was inſtantly daſh'd to pieces, at the want of that ſmall piece of Paper, which he fancied did contain great matters, and of ſuch weight peradventure, as might enlighten the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs to the great prejudice, if not total ruine of the whole deſign: while he was thus left in the dark, he gave to that word a thouſand interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all of very dangerous conſequences. He call'd himſelf a thouſand fools, for leaving any pieces of Paper behind him; he as many times curſt that miſchievous Creature, that had been the cauſe of it, and as oft he call'd himſelf unhappy and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:135663:265"/> but all this would not bring the wanting piece of Paper to the reſt; and that which added much to his ſorrow, was the coldneſs which he found in Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> as to any further at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts in his behalf; the very thoughts of the late dangers, in which he had ſo lately been ingag'd, did make him die with very fear; not knowing but that the piece of Paper that was wanting, might inform the Marqueſs of the myſtery of the Glove; ſo that
<hi>Camille</hi> had much ado to buoy him up in that Sea of fears and perplexities, wherein the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Father was almoſt over-whelm'd; yet after that <hi>Camille</hi> had read the Letter, and aſſur'd him, that there could be no ſuch ſence attributed to that word, repreſenting to him, the caution with which the Marchioneſs did always accompany all her acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the utter ruin of all his hopes, if he ſhould relent, and be heartleſs; but when he underſtood what advantages and preferment <hi>Camille</hi> did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe him, if the buſineſs were once accompliſh'd, with the Golden earneſt which <hi>Camille</hi> did inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give him in hand of it; he was quite vanquiſh'd, his hard-heartedneſs did vaniſh with his fears, ſo that he promis'd not to forſake ſo bountiful a Friend, in time of need; No, ſaid he, it ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſaid, that Father <hi>Andrew</hi> did once under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take an amorous intriegue, and left it off before it was accompliſh'd, eſpecially acting for a Patron of power, and willingneſs to protect me from all troubles and inconveniences; with that, calling for a glaſs of Wine to chear up his Spirits, and ſtay his ſtomach, till breakfaſt was ready, he drank to <hi>Camille,</hi> a Health to the beautiful Marchioneſs, and to their good ſucceſs; <hi>Camille</hi> was not back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in giving him all the incouragements
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:135663:266"/> that he could imagin; a little after, breakfaſt was up, and they having eaten, drank, and diſcours'd merrily, they laid themſelves to reſt, till it was time to return with the Glove.</p>
                  <p>Mean time the Marqueſs was poſſeſt with a more violent rage than ever. The Fellow that was carried in dead, after the adminiſtring of ſome Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials and bleedings, coming to himſelf again, had declared, that he had ſeen a Man on the very uppermoſt branches of that Tree, off of which he had fallen, who caſting ſomething in his Eyes, while he was looking up, had caus'd him to let go his hold, which was the occaſion of his fall, juſt when he was giving notice of his diſcovery. The Marqueſs had preſently ſent divers Servants to ſearch every Tree in the Garden, while he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf viſited all the underwoods; all to no purpoſe, the Featherleſs Bird being flown long before; ſo that being return'd to his Wife's Chamber, he had given a full vent unto his fury, with ſuch threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, which tended to the giving her of a
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fig, that there were cauſes to fear ſome ſuch ſad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, at ſome time or other. This did ſtrike ſuch a terror in the Marchioneſs's mind, that ſhe had no occaſion to counterfeit, for ſhe fell into a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, though not very violent. Then ſhe took a full reſolution, in order to ſave her own life, to make uſe of the Pilgrim's offers; though ſhe had once been in the mind to refuſe them, fearing that he ſhould expect, as a reward, that which ſhe could not, nor ought not to give.</p>
                  <p>This ſudden illneſs of the Marchioneſs, did make the Marqueſs, ſo ſoon as the fury of his paſſion was over, to ſend for a Phyſician, by the ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Zora,</hi> which were joyn'd to her Ladies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:135663:266"/> yet with ſo much diſcretion, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs took no further notice of it. A Servant was going for a Doctor, when at the Street-Door he met with the old peddling Woman, who was come to bring back the Glove. Who deſired to have it delivered to the Marchioneſs; the Servant an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that it could not be now, becauſe that ſhe was fallen very ill of a ſudden of a Feaver, and that he was ſent to ſeek for a Doctor; but that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Stranger, he knew not where to go. Alas! a-well-a-day, ſaid the old Woman, I am heartily ſorry for it, and ſhe has been ſo good a Cuſtomer to me, that I will bring you to the moſt eminent Doctor in Town; but he is a great Humouriſt, and a Man of very few words; and you muſt let me alone to perſuade him to go. The Fellow, glad of the opportunity, goes with the brisk old Woman, who returns to <hi>Camille,</hi> and leaving the Fellow below, while ſhe goes up to perſuade the famous Doctor; ſhe runs up to <hi>Camille,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms him of the buſineſs, then preſently going down to the Servant, ſhe told him, that he ſhould return home, and tell them, that a Doctor would be with them immediatly; and withall give him the Glove to deliver to ſome of the Marchioneſs's Women, with which the Fellow return'd home, very well contented.</p>
                  <p>Father <hi>Andrew</hi> having thus acted the ſecond part of the old Woman, he returns up to
<hi>Camille,</hi> very glad that he had quitted his hands of that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Glove; he preſently adviſes <hi>Camille</hi> to write his mind, that he might give it to the Marchioneſs, while he felt her Pulſe, and that he would go to ſome Jew-broker, and hire what was neceſſary to make a Doctor of <hi>Camille; Camille</hi> preſently falls

                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:135663:268"/>Theſe lines which were both a Panegyrick to Beauty, and a declaration of Love, did raiſe ſuch a tender vail of tincture over all the Lillies of the Marchioneſs's Cheeks, as did almoſt termine into bluſhes, when ſhe read them; ſhe gueſt at what the Pilgrim did aim, which at all other times would have caus'd her to break all further corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency with him, but as things ſtood then, not knowing how to mend her ſelf for the preſent, ſhe was glad of any opportunity, and to employ all ſorts of Inſtruments; leaving to her ſelf the management of the conſequences hereafter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Camille</hi> was inſtantly fitted, while the good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accoutres himſelf to perſonate the Mule dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. They were juſt got ready, when news was brought up, that the Marqueſs his Servant was come again for the Doctor: They go immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, the Servant leads the Van, our new vamp'd Doctor is in the Main, and Father <hi>Andrew</hi> brings up the Rear; they come to the Marqueſs his Door, the Doctor alights from his grave Beaſt, and is conducted up into the Lady's Chamber, which was made ſo dark, becauſe that the light did offend her Eyes, and caus'd her Head to ake, that the Doctor was forc'd to be conducted to the Bed-ſide, by one of her Women; there he feels her Pulſe, gives her the Letter, and making as if he ask'd her ſome private queſtions, he ſteals a kiſs from her Hand, and another from her Lips, after which he retires at ſome little diſtance from the Bed ſide; after which the Marqueſs, who had ſtood all the while near the Window, came and accoſted the Doctor, inquiring of him, how he found his Patient, and what hopes there was; to which he made no other anſwer, than that he
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:135663:268"/> would quickly go and preſcribe for her; and that when ſhe had taken what he would ſend, he would be better able to give him an account; with that the Marqueſs gives him his Fee, and away goes our Doctor.</p>
                  <p>The Marqueſs returning into his Wives Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber from conducting the Doctor, he is met by
<hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> who tells him that the Marchioneſs would ſleep, which made him retire, and take along with him the other Woman, that their chat might not diſturb her reſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zora</hi> being left ſingle with her Lady in her Chamber, ſhe asks how ſhe does, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs finding her ſelf ſomething better than ſhe had been, told her ſo, after which <hi>Zora</hi> falls down on her knees by the Bed-ſide, and with tears in her Eyes, ſhe began to ſpeak thus unto her Lady.</p>
                  <p>Madam, you may ſuſpect, and with much Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Juſtice, that whatſoever I ſhall ſay to you, may be to your prejudice, and with a deſign to intrap you, and make you more miſerable yet, than you are; and of truth I muſt needs confeſs, that when I conſider with what exactneſs I have obſerv'd and executed your Husbands orders, even with that ſeverity, which was beyond his expectation, in which <hi>I</hi> have ſhewn my ſelf moſt inhumane towards one of my own Sex though far above me in merits, and all ſorts of reſpects; <hi>I</hi> then deſpair of ever prevailing with you, to add faith to what <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſay. Therefore, Madam, <hi>I</hi> muſt be forc'd to make uſe of ſomething more than my bare words and relation, to convince you of the ſincerity of my preſent intentions: Yet thus much
<hi>I</hi> have to ſay for my ſelf; that all the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:135663:269"/> cruel ſeverity that <hi>I</hi> have ever exercis'd againſt you, has never proceeded from any particular averſion, hatred, or prejudice, that <hi>I</hi> could have againſt your perſon, but from meer intereſt and greedineſs of profit, which made me think, that the more ſevere <hi>I</hi> ſhould expreſs my ſelf againſt you, the better <hi>I</hi> ſhould be rewarded by him that had employ'd me; <hi>I</hi> was a poor miſerable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ready to periſh for want, when the Marqueſs took me into his ſervice, to be one of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his cruelty towards you; and finding the comforts of a full Table, warm covering, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refreſhments, beſides the hopes of laying up ſomething againſt my old age, which is coming on very faſt, and then reflecting with horror, on my late and miſerable condition; the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and dread of returning unto that woful ſtate again, and the obligations which <hi>I</hi> thought that <hi>I</hi> owed unto my Benefactor, were the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of all the ſorrows, troubles, and afflictions which you have ſince ſuſtained through my means, But, Madam, continued ſhe, there is no heart, though never ſo hard and cruel, but at ſome time or other will relent, and give way to ſome ſparks of compaſſion: ſince our arrival at <hi>Saragoſſa, I</hi> have had now and then ſome remorſe and pity of your condition, which has ſometime made me wiſh, that it were my Fortune to get a livelihood by any other means, than ſuch as did appear to me to be againſt all the Rules of Humanity and Religion. This has made me to reflect upon the ſeverity, which you have met with on all hands (excepting Heaven, who has plentifully recompenc'd you in all the accompliſhments of the body and mind.) Firſt from your Parents, as I have been inform'd,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:135663:269"/> who contrary to your inclinations, did force you to marry a Perſon, whom you had declared you hated, and for whom you could never have any Love; but on the contrary, that you look'd upon him as the greateſt of your Enemies. Then, Madam, when I added to this, that cruel Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that your jealous Husbands humour has caus'd him to exerciſe over you, without the leaſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion imaginable, ſince the very firſt moment that he could call you his, and the exemplary patience, with which you have endured all his unkindneſſes: Theſe things have made me divers times wiſh that you were freed from all that ſlavery in which you languiſh. But when lately, as I was looking out of the Window, I did ſee that Pilgrim, who for your ſake has ſuffer'd ſo much already, to be dragg'd and hal'd to Priſon, with as little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, as it had been a Dog, it came within my thoughts, that if this poor Gentleman did ſuffer ſo much for your ſake, only for endeavouring to free you from that miſery you groan under; what did I deſerve, that was one of the unworthy inſtruments of your afflictions. Yet, Madam, this is not all; that which has concluded this through Reformation in me, are thoſe Words that your Husband does frequently let fall in his paſſions of late; which ſpeak as if he would attempt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt your Life: Thoſe indeed reach'd to my very Heart. Theſe things, Madam, have made me enter into ſome ſerious conſiderations within my ſelf, from them I am come to reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and thoſe have brought me to a firm reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rather to periſh, than to live through ſo unworthy means as I do at preſent; and to prefer your liberty and content, unto that proſpect
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:135663:270"/> which I had of making my Fortune, by continu- to be your Keeper: Not without hopes, Madam, that if you ſhould get out of your Bondage, through my aſſiſtance, you would conſider my Services, and make up my loſſes another way. And now, Madam, to confirm what
<hi>I</hi> have ſaid, and convince you, that it proceeds from a due ſenſe of your miſeries, which has produced a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and ſincere repentance in me; be pleas'd to look on this Paper: With that ſhe gave the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs that Paper, which the Marqueſs had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up in the Garden; telling her that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, pulling out his Handkerchief, had drop'd it, and that ſhe having taken it up, look'd on it, and found it did ſo much concern her, ſhe kept it to give it her, notwithſtanding the great inquiries and ſearch which the Marqueſs had made after it, ſhe having flatly deny'd to him, that ſhe had ſeen any. The Marchioneſs having taken it, reads as follows.</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>—<hi>The Doctor, as you have formerly the Pilgrim, give me an account of your reſolutions, by the counterfeit old Woman, when ſhe brings me the Glove, who was ſo excellently diſguis'd, that I did not know the good Father</hi> Andrew, <hi>till he had given me ſome ſigns of it.</hi>

                  </floatingText>
                  <p>That was enough to let the Marchioneſs know, that this was the latter part of her Letter to the Pilgrim, which ſhe had dropp'd out of her Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. This did fully confirm her, that
<hi>Zora</hi> was a true Convert, which did give her very great ſatisfaction, but when ſhe thought that her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band had ſeen it, by which he would diſcover the whole Plot, ſhe viſibly chang'd colour, and was yielding to her ſorrow, when <hi>Zora</hi> told her that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:135663:270"/> ſhe ſhould be chearful, and hope the beſt; for by the Marqueſs his ſilence, and not inquiring after the old Woman, mention'd in that Paper, it is, Madam, eontinued ſhe, an argument that he has not read it, he would be ſo impatient otherwiſe to be reveng'd of Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> whom he mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hates, that he could not have forborn inquiring after the old Woman an hundred times over; and beſides, Madam, preſently after he had let fall the Paper, he ſeem'd much troubled, and was looking up and down for it; which makes me eonclude, that he has not read it. The confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he was in at firſt, by the fall of the man from the Tree, having certainly put it out of his Head, and when he had loſt it then he thought of it again. But what confirms me moſt of all, is, that when the Glove was given to my fellow Servant, ſhe was met by the Marqueſs, who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looking on it, did return it her again, without ſpeaking one word more, than asking whether the Woman was paid for it.</p>
                  <p>That indeed is ſignificant then ſaid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs: and now <hi>Zora,</hi> I find that I may breathe again; I believe your Converſion to be ſincere and real; and <hi>I</hi> do aſſure you, that you ſhall have no cauſe to repent it; but on the contrary the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er you ſerve me in my deſigns, of freeing my ſelf from that ſlavery in which <hi>I</hi> live, under continual apprehenſions of loſing my life, and perpetual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reproaches and affronts without cauſe, the ſooner you will feel the effects of my bounty, which <hi>I</hi> aſſure you ſhall extend to the making you hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py the reſidue of your days. <hi>I</hi> wanted but a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to aſſiſt me in my reſolutions; and now <hi>I</hi> have thee, <hi>I</hi> ſhall willingly embrace the ſuccour and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:135663:271"/> aſſiſtance which the Pilgrim does offer me. <hi>I</hi> did fear, before, to fall alone into the hands of a young man, who was an abſolute Stranger to me, and might peradventure take all the advantages that could be againſt me, and expect ſuch rewards as virtue would forbid me to give: but now <hi>I</hi> will firſt make my own terms, and oblige him to put me into thoſe hands that <hi>I</hi> ſhall think fit; for my deſign being not to wholly abandon my Husband, but to retire from his paſſions, till by ſome Friends, a better underſtanding is wrought between us, and ſo return to him again; if my deliverer ſhould require more of me than my honour would permit me to allow of, <hi>I</hi> ſhould let him know his miſtake; and this <hi>I</hi> have ſome reaſons to fear from his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in his late viſit, under the habit of a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian. Here <hi>Zora</hi> did reiterate her Proteſtations, aſſuring the Marchioneſs that ſhe needed but to command, and ſhe ſhould find how readily ſhe would obey, even with the hazzard of her Life. <hi>I</hi> am ſatisfied, continued the Marchioneſs, and to confirm it to you, prepare your ſelf to follow the Doctor, ſo ſoon as he ſhall return, for <hi>I</hi> will ſend you after him with a Letter, in which <hi>I</hi> will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my mind to him, and make my own condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, before <hi>I</hi> put my ſelf into his hands, and you ſhall bring me back a full and poſitive anſwer. <hi>Zora</hi> told the Marchioneſs, that ſhe would preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ask the Marqueſs leave to go forth, to ſee a Kinſwoman of hers, that liv'd in Town, and that under that pretence ſhe would wait on the Doctor. This being concluded on, the Marchioneſs bid her go call in her fellow Servant to ſtay by her, while ſhe ſhould go get her Pen, Ink, and Paper, and convey it into her Cloſet, where ſhe would
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:135663:271"/> go and write the Letter to the Pilgrim, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of going to her devotions; <hi>Zora</hi> being gone, and the other Woman come in her place, the Marchioneſs laid her ſelf upon her Bed again not ſo much to ſleep, as to reflect upon <hi>Camille</hi>'s bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>She fear'd that that Perſon who had the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to kiſs her, ſo ſoon as he came near her, while her Husband and her Guardians were in the Chamber, would attempt more if he ſhould once have her in his poſſeſſion, and without company, and her apprehenſions did ſo increaſe, the more ſhe did think on it, that without that aſſiſtance which ſhe did expect from the Convert <hi>Zora</hi> ſhe had not ſo much as writ to the Pilgrim further, than juſt to let him know that her mind was alter'd, and therefore had no further occaſion of his aſſiſtance, but ſhe thought that through <hi>Zora</hi>'s aid ſhe might ſo order things, as to continue Miſtreſs of her ſelf, though got from her Husband by the Pilgrim's help, eſpecially making her conditions with him before-hand; therefore ſo ſoon as <hi>Zora</hi> was return'd, and had made her ſigns, that the writing tools were in a readineſs, the Marchioneſs pretending to go to her Prayers, did lock her ſelf up in her Cloſet, where ſhe wrote the Pilgrim.</p>
                  <p>She had but juſt ended her Letter, when the Woman knockt at her Cloſet Door, and told her that the Doctor had ſent ſomething for her to take. She preſently came out, ſaying that ſhe was much better than ſhe had been in the morning, and that ſhe hop'd the worſt was paſt for that preſent; but that however ſhe would take ſomething for two or three days to prevent a return; and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:135663:272"/> that the Doctor ſhould come again at Night to give her a viſit.</p>
                  <p>Father <hi>Andrew</hi> who was now the Doctors man, gave the Marchioneſs a Bottle of Julep, and a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in which was written how ſhe was to take it, and told the Marchioneſs, that his Maſter had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to aſſure her he would give her a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit at night, to learn how her remedy did agree with her. The Marchioneſs having ſomething to ſay to the Doctors Man, ſhe ſent the Woman out of the Chamber of an errand, bidding her ſend in her fellow Servant in the mean time; the Woman was no ſooner gone out, and the other come in, but the Marchioneſs told the good Father that <hi>Zora</hi> was become one of them, that ſhe would ſend her to the Pilgrim with a Letter before he ſhould come to her at night, to inform him of ſome matters, that therefore he ſhould preſently tell her where their Lodgings were. The Father had but juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd her, when the Marqueſs was heard coming to the Chamber-Door, which made them to change their diſcourſe: the Marqueſs enter'd, and ſeeing the Doctors Man, and the Julep Bottle ſtanding upon the Table: <hi>What,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is this what the Doctor has order'd for my Wife to take? and what direction has ſhe?</hi> Father <hi>Andrew</hi> who was more fearful of being known by his voice, than by being ſeen, becauſe that ſo ſoon as they had heard the Marqueſs coming they had drawn the Window Curtains, and gone to the darkeſt part of the room, he was wiping his face, in lieu of anſwering, which made the Marchioneſs, who gueſt at the cauſe of his ſilence, to anſwer that he had given her directions; Let's ſee them, ſaid the Marqueſs; It was only by word of Mouth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:135663:272"/> the Marchioneſs. I am of opinion, ſaid the Marqueſs, that my Wife ſhould be blooded, and that it ſhould have been the firſt thing ſhould have been done; I am ſure ſhe wants it, her blood is hot enough, too hot I have reaſon to fear. The Marchioneſs not taking the leaſt notice of what the Marqueſs had ſaid, made anſwer that ſhe would have the man return preſently to his Maſter, and deſire him to come again ſo ſoon as he could, and then that they ſhould conſult about it. With this the Doctor's man, very glad of this meſſage, ſcrap'd a Leg, and did not ſtay to be bid once again; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the Woman that the Marchioneſs had ſent out came in, and told the Marqueſs, that there was ſome-body without, that would ſpeak with him: This made him go ſee who it was; mean time, the Marchioneſs under pretence to go make an end of her Devotions, return'd into her Cloſet, where having open'd the Papers of Directions, ſhe found writ as follows.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>You ſhall never make any mention of Love, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out particular leave, or any other reward for your Services, than may be expected from my Purſe; but leave me the ſole Judge and Recompencer of your merits in my Eſteem, Friendſhip, and Affections, and to diſpoſe of my favours as I ſhall think fit. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall you importune me with unſeaſonable and frequent viſits, but by permiſſion likewiſe.</hi>

                  <p>The Marchioneſs having written this Letter, gave it ſecretly to <hi>Zora,</hi> who was not long before ſhe went with it unto <hi>Camille's</hi> Lodgings; where you may imagin that ſhe was joyfully receiv'd, <hi>Zora</hi> gave <hi>Camille</hi> the Letter, with an account of her Converſion, and full reſolution to aſſiſt them
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:135663:275"/> with her life, in the freeing of the Marchioneſs from that ſlavery, under which ſhe lived. <hi>Camille</hi> having, according to his accuſtomed generoſity, fill'd both
<hi>Zora</hi>'s hands with Gold, he told her that it was but an earneſt of what he intended for her, ſo ſoon as the Marchioneſs were ſet at liberty; he read the Letter, which he had no ſooner done, but that he kiſs'd it, and ſaid, I do declare here to you both, in the preſence of Heaven, that I will exactly perform, and obey every particular Article, and the whole that is injoyn'd to me in this Paper, by the moſt beautiful Marchioneſs, ſo help me Goodneſs. Of this Declaration and Promiſe, I do intreat you to inform the Marchioneſs. After this they were contriving of ſome ways to get the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs off; <hi>Camille</hi> was for getting of her out at the Window in the Night time; but that was not found to be convenient by
<hi>Zora,</hi> who beſt knew how the Marqueſs did uſe to behave himſelf at Nights, how diligently he did watch ſo ſoon as it was but a little darkiſh; ſo that though ſhe ſhould have the opportunity to aſſiſt them at ſome time in her fellow Guardians abſence; yet it would be very difficult to eſcape the Marqueſs his diligence. Father
<hi>Andrew,</hi> in his turn, did propoſe ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expedients, againſt which
<hi>Camille</hi> objected. At laſt <hi>Zora</hi> ſaid, that if they would but give her that Nights time to conſider of it, ſhe made no queſtion that by morning ſhe would, with her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies aſſiſtance, find out ſome way better than they had yet propoſed. You do not know, continued ſhe, how ready our Sex is in contriving of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues? it is in a manner natural unto us, we need but to lay aſide other concerns for a while; and in that time, though never ſo ſhort, our own
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:135663:275"/> inclinations will prompt us to amorous deſigns; <hi>I</hi> have one in my Head already, which <hi>I</hi> could tell you preſently, but <hi>I</hi> will take a little longer time to digeſt it into better order than it is yet, and beſides, <hi>I</hi> am unwilling to propoſe any thing of that nature to you, without the Marchioneſs's conſent. <hi>I</hi> will therefore return to her, that <hi>I</hi> may get ſome convenient time to acquaint her with it, and to have her advice and addition of contrivance, againſt you come to give her a viſit in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Camille</hi> approving of her diſcretion, diſmiſs'd her, deſiring her to be faithful and active, and that he would be careful to gratify her, in an ample manner.</p>
                  <p>It was not long before that <hi>Zora</hi> got home, where ſhe met with the Marqueſs, who told her that he was glad to ſee her ſo diligent, and that ſeeing ſhe had been ſo, ſhe ſhould have his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent another time to go out; that he was ſorry for what his paſſion had made him do; but continue faithful to your truſt, added he, and I ſhall make you amends for it: at theſe words the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Gipſy fell into Tears, and ſaid, that ſhe had deſerv'd a better uſage from him, in her watchful care over her charge, and that there were many Women, that would revenge themſelves of ſuch a wrong; but that ſhe was ſuch a low Spirited Fool, that had not ſo much courage as a Worm, who would turn again when twas trod on, though to little purpoſe; that ſhe had no other way of ſatisfying her ſelf, but with taking a Doſe of that drowſy Medicine Patience; then carrying her Handkerchief to her Eyes, ſhe ſeemed to be very much troubled; at which the Marqueſs, pulling out of his Pocket a piece of Gold, he gave it her,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:135663:276"/> ſaying, Here, <hi>Zora,</hi> take this, and aſſure thy ſelf, that for the future I ſhall be more kind to thee, if thou wilt continue faithful to me; for I aſſure thee, that I confide more in thee, than in thy fellow Guardian, of whom of late, I have no good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Well, Sir, anſwered <hi>Zora,</hi> ſince that you are ſo kind, and have a better opinion of me than of my Companion, it ſhall not be without cauſe; therefore prepare your ſelf to hear of ſome diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries from me e're long; but then you muſt give me the opportunity, to be ſome time in private with my Lady this Evening, that I may ſift her: Yes, that thou ſhalt, as long as thou wilt, reply'd the Marqueſs, I will take order my ſelf, to have thy fellow Servant employ'd another way at that time. Well, Sir, reply'd <hi>Zora,</hi> and to begin to be ſincere with you, I muſt tell you that my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy has a Black lead Pencil, which I have not known of before this morning. How! reply'd the the Marqueſs, a Black lead Pencil? And in the name of the Devil, how came ſhe by it? That I know not, reply'd <hi>Zora,</hi> except my fellow Servant has help'd her to it. <hi>I</hi> do obſerve that of late they are very great together; though not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, for <hi>I</hi> never come into the Chamber, but <hi>I</hi> find them talking, and ſo ſoon as they ſee me, they are as mute as Statues. Oh Heavens! cry'd out the Marqueſs, for certain thou haſt over-heard ſome of their diſcourſes; prithee good
<hi>Zora</hi> tell me what thou haſt heard: Truly nothing very ſignificant, anſwered ſhe, only here and there a word, for they ſpeak very low: and the Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs is as afraid of me, and hates me as much as ſhe loves my Fellow: But good now tell me ſome of thoſe words that thou haſt heard, continued the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:135663:276"/> Marqueſs: what <hi>I</hi> can remember now, is that they talk'd of a Letter loſt, or torn, <hi>I</hi> know not well which, and of Fryars, Pilgrims, and — Hold, hold, cry'd the Marqueſs, interrupting her, what didſt thou name a Pilgrim? Yes, Sir, that word Pilgrim is very frequent in their Mouths: O! the Devil, Hell, and Confuſion! a Pilgrim? Why has the Devil nothing elſe to do, beſides poſſeſſing of Women, than to multiply Pilgrims, or to ſlit one in ſeveral pieces? It is moſt certainly, <hi>I</hi> ſee it now, that that Damnable Pilgrim, your treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Fellow, and the Devil himſelf are in league, and hold a correſpondency with that wicked Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man my Wife, notwithſtanding all my cares, the Womans preciſeneſs, the Pilgrim's impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Devil's employ about debauching of other Women alſo. In good time haſt thou diſcover'd this to me, for which <hi>I</hi> ſhall reward thee moſt bountifully; one day more of their helliſh intrigues, and they had left us behind, for over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking them again: Then after a little pauſe: It muſt be ſo continued he, didſt thou not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ame a Fryar alſo? <hi>I</hi> think that <hi>I</hi> have heard them men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a certain Father, reply'd <hi>Zora; Andrew,</hi> cry'd out the Marqueſs; <hi>I</hi> know not, ſaid <hi>Zora,</hi> if the Fryar is the Father, or whether they are two diſtinct Perſons; but if you will have the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to hearken your ſelf to their diſcourſes, <hi>I</hi> will ſo place you, that you ſhall over hear ſome words, though they ſpeak never ſo low; <hi>I</hi> wiſh thou couldſt do that, reply'd the Marqueſs, though <hi>I</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thee already; yet that would ſtrangely ſtrengthen my belief, and the good opinion that I have of thee; and ſhould I once hear that that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould ſpeak one word to my Wife, but
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:135663:277"/> tending towards kindneſs, <hi>I</hi> would immediately turn her away: That
<hi>I</hi> would not adviſe you to do, reply'd <hi>Zora,</hi> till you were very certain that ſhe is falſe to you; what greater proof could <hi>I</hi> have of it, reply'd the Marqueſs, than to be an Eye and Ear-witneſs to the buſineſs: Well <hi>I</hi> long to hear their cloſe diſcourſes; that, Sir, you muſt not expect to do, ſaid <hi>Zora,</hi> till in the Evening after <hi>I</hi> have had ſome diſcourſe with my Lady. Well, ſaid the Marqueſs, go, go, get thee to her, and ſift her through Lawn; <hi>I</hi> will call away that Gipſy, that thou mayſt have the more opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do it, go thou in, and ſend her out to me, and ſaying this, he puſh'd her gently from him towards the Marchioneſs's Chamber door.</p>
                  <p>The ſubtle <hi>Zora</hi> was no ſooner come into the Ladies Chamber, but ſent the other out, telling her that the Marqueſs had ſomething to ſay to her; and having ſhut the Door, ſhe gave the Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs an account of all that had paſs'd between the three Confederates, and how freely <hi>Camille</hi> had promis'd to obey her commands, to the very leaſt circumſtance; to which ſhe added this ſhort Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. <hi>I</hi> muſt needs tell you, Madam, that in my opinion he is a Perſon of Quality and Honour, who though under a diſguiſe cannot but ſhew it in all his actions; for he is doubtleſs, the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd Gentleman in the whole World, having in him in a high meaſure, all that can be deſired for perfecting of the moſt exact Cavalier imaginable; his courteous carriage, his obliging expreſſions, comely preſence, and his generous liberality, of which here is a fair and ample demonſtration, (ſhewing the Gold that <hi>Camille</hi> had given her) will make me think the time a thouſand Years, till <hi>I</hi>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:135663:277"/> ſee you free from your Husbands jealous Tyranny, and under the ſafe Guard of ſo worthy a Perſon. From this diſcourſe ſhe fell to ſpeak of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, and gave the Marchioneſs an exact account of what had paſs'd between him and her ſelf, and how bravely ſhe had cox'd him. And now, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, <hi>I</hi> am come, continued ſhe, by his order to ſift you; but if you pleaſe to take a little of my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, we will give my Fellow a remove, puniſh your Husbands unreaſonable Jealouſie, and you ſhall have a very Comical Revenge, all which ſhall tend to make a clearer way unto your deliverance. <hi>I</hi> have ingag'd you, Madam, continued ſhe, in a buſineſs, which if but well manag'd will do all this and more: Prithee let's hear it, <hi>Zora,</hi> reply'd the Marchioneſs? Why thus, Madam, ſaid <hi>Zora,</hi> ſo ſoon as <hi>I</hi> am gone out, and my Fellow Servant come in, I would have you to get into your Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with her, and there ingage her into ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning Pilgrims, Fryars, Fathers, Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Jealouſie, Liberty, and the like. For <hi>I</hi> have promis'd your Husband, ſo to place him that he ſhall-over hear thoſe private diſcourſes, which
<hi>I</hi> have told him you frequently have with her, when <hi>I</hi> am out of the way; and
<hi>I</hi> have pick'd out your Cloſet Window for his ſtand: by this means he will be ſo incenſed againſt my Fellow Servant, that no queſtion but he will immediately turn her away, which will give us much more liberty and opportunity than we have, to act and accompliſh our deſigns. This pleas'd the Marchioneſs very well, who ſaid, but how ſhall <hi>I</hi> bring out thoſe words to any purpoſe, ſo that he nor ſhe may not perceive the deſign? Madam, anſwer'd <hi>Zora, I</hi> will leave you to conſider of it, you that have ſo
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:135663:278"/> much wit and induſtrey, will preſently find out ſome expedient for it; be pleas'd but to give me your black-lead Pen, which <hi>I</hi> promis'd to preſent your Husband with, and I am gone: The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs gave her the Pencil, of which ſhe had no longer need, ſince that ſhe had been furniſh'd with other writing Tools, and <hi>Zora</hi> went to give it to the Marqueſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zora</hi> was no ſooner out of the Marchioneſs's Chamber, but that the other Woman was in, who found the Marchioneſs lain on her Bed: <hi>Zora</hi> went to the Marqueſs, who receiv'd her with great demonſtration of a longing deſire, to learn what ſhe had to ſay to him, and what new diſcoveries ſhe had made: Well, ſaid he to her, what news doſt thou bring me, and what ſucceſs haſt thou had? The Marchioneſs is ſo out of humour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Zora,</hi> becauſe that I broke the diſcourſe which they had began in my abſence, and which was not endeed when I came into her Chamber, that do what I could, I have not been able to make her enter into diſcourſe. I have began to ſpeak of divers things, one after another, thinking to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage her into talk, but after two or three words, ſhe lets it fall, ſo that I have loſt my labour for this Evening; but ſhe will not be long ſilent, now that ſhe has that Perſon with her, with whom ſhe may freely diſcourſe, and lay open her heart; ſhe will quickly regain the time that ſhe thinks to have loſt with me, though ſhe feign'd to me that ſhe had a mind to ſleep. Without doubt, ſaid the Marqueſs, ſhe will be very eager to be at it with her Jewel, and now I warrant you that ſhe is full of news to tell her, therefore that I may loſe no time, I would have thee to place me where I may
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:135663:278"/> hear as much as I can poſſible of what they ſay: Sir, replyed
<hi>Zora,</hi> they uſually retire into the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, when they intend any private diſcourſes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no place more fit for you, than the Cloſet Window in the Garden, it is but ſtanding upon ſomething, and that will raiſe you to a ſufficient height; I will go and fit things ready for you to ſtand on, and come to you again: That will do very well, reply'd the Marqueſs, and I like that place the better too, becauſe that there I ſhall not be interrupted by any of the Servants, for I will lock my ſelf up in the Garden, where through the obſcurity of the Night, none ſhall ſee me. That will do very well, anſwer'd <hi>Zora:</hi> With that ſhe went to prepare the Stage, on which the Marqueſs was to act the Eve-droppers part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zora</hi> ſcarce got out, but that the Marqueſs, who was very unwilling to loſe one word of his Wifes diſcourſe with her Guardian, went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to his Chamber door, to try if he could hear any thing from thence; but becauſe that the Marchioneſs was not yet prepar'd, ſhe remaining ſtill on her Bed ſilent, the Marqueſs return'd to his Chamber again to expect
<hi>Zora;</hi> ſhe mean time was buſie in fitting of things, but more earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in contriving ſome way to puniſh this jealous Man. She was not long before ſhe return'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to fit him on all accounts. She acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with it, telling him that ſhe had been forc'd to make uſe of an old Water-Tub that lay uſeleſs in a corner of the Garden, over which ſhe had plac'd ſome Boards and a Stool over them, that it would be ſomething difficult for him to get up alone, but that once up, he might ſtand firm e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that he ſhould give her the Key of the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:135663:279"/> back door into the Garden, and that She would meet him that way. The Marqueſs had ſuch a longing deſire to be at the ſport, that he lik'd e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that ſhe did propoſe, he therefore ſent her away with the Key of the back door, while he himſelf went the fore way into the Garden, where he lock'd himſelf in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zora</hi> mean time ſends a Perſon whom ſhe truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Camille</hi>'s Lodgings with a Note to give him notice, that if he would have ſome paſtime, he ſhould immediately repair to the back door of the Marqueſs's Garden, where ſhe would wait for him, and where the Marqueſs was going to act a very pleaſant Scene, as ſhe had order'd things. For ſhe had faſtned a Cord to one of the Boards over the Tub, which having convey'd on the other ſide of an Hedge, where ſhe was to lye in wait; ſo ſoon as he would have heard enough to have made him mad, to conclude the Comedy, ſhe deſign'd to pull that Cord, and of neceſſity the Marqueſs muſt have fallen, that juſt upon that <hi>Camille</hi> ſhould appear and make an end of affrighting him, ſo that he ſhould not know what had hapned, nor how, or by what means; but the Marqueſs's impatiency, and <hi>Camille's</hi> abſence from home, for he had then come forth in order to viſit the Marchioneſs, did prevent her; for ſo ſoon as the Marqueſs was got into the Garden, he could not forbear endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to get up of himſelf; he thought that each mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he paſt without liſtening, was ſo many loſt ſentences; and what did he know, but that which would give him the greater light in their myſteries, would be the firſt ſpoken, and that the reſt would be but indifferent diſcourſe; he
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:135663:279"/> goes preſently to work, and endeavours Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor like to mount the Stage of himſelf, and without the aſſiſtance of his merry <hi>Andrew;</hi> but wanting ſomething to raiſe him a little from the ground, to facilitate his firſt ſteps, which were ſomething high, and finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more convenient than a roling Stone that was at hand; de draws it where he would have it, he ſets one of his Feet upon it, and the other up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Board that was over the Tub, which had in it ſome Water; he had but one ſtep more to make, which was upon the Stool, and having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to get hold of to aſſiſt him, there he was at a ſtand, what he ſhould do, but preſently fancying that he did hear them talk; he endeavours to get up by leaning againſt the Wall, he puſhes hard, and ſo hard at laſt, that the Board underneath the Stool ſlipping aſide, the Stool fell into the Tub, but he being very nimble eſcapes it, and lighting on the roling Stone with violence, it yielded for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which threw him back, with his Head for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into the middle of the Stool which was in the Tub of Water. There lay the poor Marqueſs with his Head in the ſtinking muddy Water, up to the Shoulders, and they and his Arms ſo pini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on d in the Stool, that he could not help himſelf, but of neceſſity muſt have been ſmother'd in that filthy Bath. He endeavour'd to cry out for help, but inſtead of that, he did make the moſt hideous noiſe that could be imagin d, for his bubbling in the Water, whence he forc'd himſelf to cry out, and the ſound of the Tub, though not very deep, did render ſuch a ſtrange ſound, that nothing can be compar'd to it, but the roaring of a Bull, that had a hole in his Wind-pipe. The noiſe, in fine,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:135663:280"/> was ſo great, that it caus'd all the Windows of the Neighbourhood to be open'd, and the darkneſs hiding the Object from their Eyes, they all ask'd one another what was the matter; but at laſt the noiſe growing leſs and leſs, as his Strength and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits did decay, every body retired, and ſhut their Windows again.</p>
                  <p>The poor Marqueſs was in this condition juſt giving up the Ghoſt, when <hi>Zora</hi> came to him, who preſently, though ſtrangely ſurpriz'd and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, did with much ado pull the Stool out of the Tub, and the Marqueſs with it, who having laid on the ground, there he remain'd dead; ſhe was upon the point of running away by the back Door to give her Lady notice of it, but ſhe fancied that he breath'd a little; this made her change her mind, and ſhe was for ſome time in a Ballance, whether ſhe ſhould aſſiſt him and ſave his Life, or let him go, and carry along with him all the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s troubles, ſo put an end to all their Plots; but at laſt good Nature partly prevailing, and the deſires that ſhe had in making more ſport, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further employ'd, beſides, the Rewards that ſhe did expect, and not knowing to what conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences this his ſudden Death might draw; ſhe ſtoop'd to him, and did ſo chafe, rub and handle him, that as he lay with his back acroſs the Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stone, his Head hanging down, he at laſt vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted up a large quantity of that naſty ſtinking Water, which he had ſwallowed moſt plentifully, which was followed with a great groan and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after with a <hi>Jeſu Maria:</hi> This did ſo incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the induſtrious <hi>Zora,</hi> that with the continuance of her moſt favourable aſſiſtance; the poor man having empty'd his Stomach of more of his Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:135663:280"/> draught, he came to himſelf as to ſit up; ſhe inquired how he did, and how he hapned by this accident, but he was ſo weak with drinking, ſo ſore with ſtruggling, and ſo hoarſe with endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to be heard, that he only told her, by being too haſty; and a while after, bidding her to lead him up to her own Chamber in private, he after that remain'd ſilent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zora</hi> having lifted him up upon his Legs, and taken out of his Pocket the Key of the Garden-door, ſhe led him under the Arm without light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Chamber, where ſhe laid him upon the Bed; he had no ſooner been let go upon it, but that he fell a giving up the reſidue of the raw Candle, and calling for a little Wine, he fainted away. He was preſently ſupply'd with ſome, which brought him to himſelf again; he gave her his hand, that ſhe might help him to ſit up, after which be gave her a ſhort account of his diſaſter; which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with a great demonſtration of ſorrow for having fail'd of hearing his Wife's Dialogue with her fellow Servant. I do not blame thee in the leaſt <hi>Zora,</hi> continued he, for what has hapned to me, but acknowledge it my own fault; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I confeſs, that without thy timely Aſſiſtance I muſt have periſh'd, for which good office I will kindly reward thee; I am in a very ſad pickle, help to ſhift me, that I may go to my Wife; for though I ſhould be glad to lye from her this Night, that ſhe might not have the leaſt diſtruſt of my misfortune, at which ſhe would make her ſelf ſport, I durſt not truſt her alone, eſpecially with that wicked Woman, while thou ſhould'ſt be buſied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout me. Sir, you do very well, replyed
<hi>Zora,</hi> to lye with her, and you cannot be too wary, for
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:135663:281"/> the Marchioneſs might do in a quarter of an hours time, that which you could never undo again; when you are in Bed with her, then ſhe is ſecure, and ſo long as you have but one of your hands over her, you may ſleep in ſafety: Thou ſayſt very true, reply'd the Marqueſs, therefore fetch me what I want, and as thou paſſeſt by, ſtep into her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and ſee what they are doing. <hi>Zora</hi> went out, and preſently return'd, telling him that now his Wife was as pleaſant as mirth could make her, they are laughing at the relation which they have had of the hideous noiſe that was heard in the Garden, and of the ſeveral reports that are given of it, ſome ſay that it was a ſurpriz'd Lover by a jealous Husband, or ſome jealous Coxcomb catch'd in his own trap; at which the Marchioneſs adds, that ſhe wiſh'd they were all ſo ſerv'd. Yea, that I dare ſay ſhe would, reply'd the Marqueſs; no matter how 'twere cenſur'd: Oh! the Plague of Women! continued he, of handſom Women! Well, if ſhe makes me once deſperate, I ſhall lodge her far and ſafe enough from her Minion, and from the whole World beſides. She is mine now, continued he, far from her fond Relations, and within the reach of my revenge, and — He was going on in that ſtrain, when <hi>Zora</hi> interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him in this manner: I cannot blame your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments, they are but juſt and reaſonable; for now that ſhe is your Wife, ſhe ſhould have no Eyes, but to look on you, no Ears but to hearken after your commands, no Mouth, but to applaud them, nor no other parts, but wherewith to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them; and in my opinion, a Wife that does otherways, and ſo forgets her ſelf, as to have the leaſt thought imaginable for another Man than her
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:135663:281"/> Husband, ought to be us'd accordingly. I would it her live, continued ſhe, but it ſhould be ſuch a life, ſo remote from all Converſation, that ſhe ſhould forget the very ſhape of all men but that of her Husband. Woman, ſaid the Marqueſs with a tranſport, thou haſt won my heart; in thus ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very Soul of truth, and I ſhall ever like thee the better for it. No, I will not meddle with her Life, though of late I have had ſuch thoughts; but I will before I am two days older remove her into a place where ſhe ſhall be ſequeſtred from the whole World, but my ſelf, and one or two Women at the moſt, to give her her neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. I hope, Sir, replyed <hi>Zora,</hi> that you will continue me in your Service, and that I ſhall be one of thoſe two that ſhall attend her: why doſt thou doubt it, reply'd the Marqueſs! yes, that thou ſhalt, and were it not that it were too toyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to thee, thou ſhouldſt be ſole Governeſs of her; but however, for thoſe good Services that thou haſt render'd me, and thoſe which I yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from thee, though I ſhall give thee an aid, thou ſhalt have a full and abſolute power over all but me; I will declare it to be my will, and then who ſhall dare to control it. <hi>Zora</hi> return'd him humble thanks, with a profound reverence, and ſaying, Sir, give me leave to go ſee what they are doing: She went out of the Chamber, it was not long before ſhe return'd, telling the Marqueſs, that now there was an Opportunity for him to hear them in Diſcourſe, for ſhe had heard them at it, as ſhe went into the Chamber, that on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den they had been very ſilent, and that no doubt but they would be at it again by this time: the cunning <hi>Zora</hi> had been in the Chamber, of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:135663:282"/> truth, and had given the Marchioneſs that ſign, of which they had before agreed together, at which the Marchioneſs was to begin her Story: The greedy Marqueſs did need no more to ſpur him on, but as if there had been no ſuch matter as that of the Tub in the caſe: my Hat, my Sword, and Cloak, ſaid he, and I am gone, I would not loſe one word of theirs, not for all the eaſe imaginable: A word, reply'd <hi>Zora,</hi> why you muſt not expect to hear one in ten, but however that will ſuffice to give you an account of the matter of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, at which the Marqueſs returning no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, went muffled up to his Wives Chamber door, where after a while he heard as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
                  <p>The Marchioneſs lying on the Bed had call'd her Woman to her, and had told her in a manner, as if newly awakned by <hi>Zora</hi>'s coming into the Chamber, and as being affrighted, that ſhe was very much out of order, and diſturb'd with a ſtrange Dream which ſhe had had, or rather a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſaid ſhe, for I have ſo perfect an Idea ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining of what I have lately ſeen in my Dream, that I cannot well recollect my ſelf, to know whether I was ſleeping or waking. I fancy that I ſee yet all the Perſons before me; here ſtood one, there another, at this ſide of the Bed was another, another was in this Chair. The one had ſuch Cloaths on, the other was dreſt like a Religious man, one like a Cavalier, and one in a diſguiſe like a Hermit, Pilgrim, or ſome ſuch thing, and there was a Woman alſo; and amongſt all theſe Perſons there was a Monſter looſe in my Chamber, whoſe Head was very large, with a full Fore-head, no Horns on it naturally, but it
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:135663:282"/> would order his Wings, that they would lye over its forehead much like Horns, and was pleas'd to wear them ſo; his Eyes were very piercing, even to ſee things that none elſe could perceive, and the further remote that Objects were, the bigger they appear'd to it: Its Ears were very large and open, ſo that it could hear the leaſt Whiſper; Its Mouth was but ſmall, out of which iſſued forth a ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breath, that did offend all that it came near, and it darted out of it a Tongue that would wound all thoſe that it touch'd. The Marqueſs was come to the Door, when the Marchioneſs was about this part of the Story, and ſhe ſpoke ſo low, that he could hear but here and there a word, of which he could make nothing; ſhe was going on in this manner, This Monſter would often make toward me, as if to devour me, and would ſhew his Teeth, but did not bite; but his Tongue was more to be fear'd, than his Teeth, and always as he made at me, he would be hindred by ſome of thoſe that ſtood by me; and when he would make towards any body elſe, I would give them notice of it: Then I thought that he would make at me again, with more fury than before, ſo that he was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, ready to ſwallow me up; at which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man would pray, and uſe ſuch Exorciſms as the Church has ordain'd againſt evil Spirits, while that the diſguis'd Perſon would ſtrike at him, with a Sword which he had conceal'd under his Cloaths, not to hurt him, but to affright him with the ſplendour of it; but then the Woman would ſtay his Arm, and when at any time this diſguis'd Perſon would offer to ſtep between me and the Monſter, when it came to offend me, ſhe would interpoſe again, betwixt him and me, ſo that I
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:135663:283"/> could not ſee him. At laſt I thought that the Monſter had ſomething thrown upon its Head that was naſty and filthy, which did ſo torment it, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Perſons preſent, that it caſt forth a great quantity of Foam and Smoke, which did very much offend all that were preſent, but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly me, and the diſguis'd Perſon, becauſe that we ſtood near one another, and moſt in his way, and that he aim'd moſt at us two: Then I thought that on the ſudden it turn'd towards the Cavalier, who to ſhun him, fell upon the diſguis'd Perſon, ſo that he did wedge him in a Chair ſo faſt, that he could not move out of it, till after ſome time, that the Woman took him by the Hand, and help'd him out; but I thought that while the diſguis'd Perſon was ſo faſt, that the Monſter came to me, and took me on his horned Wings to carry me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, when I was awakned by <hi>Zora's</hi> coming in: This was my Dream, continued the Marchioneſs, was it not a frightful one? At this the Woman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd ſilent, only ſmiling to her ſelf, which made the Marchioneſs to ſay, <hi>What do you laugh at it? No, Madam,</hi> anſwer'd the Woman, <hi>but I cannot be ſo much frighted at it, as you are; and when your diſturbance is over, no queſtion but you will ſmile at it alſo, eſpecially if you would take but a little pains to apply this Dream to ſome of your own concerns. What can it concern me,</hi> reply'd the Marchioneſs? <hi>You will quickly comprehend it, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> ſaid the Woman, <hi>if you pleaſe but to reflect a little upon it. I am too much troubled at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of it,</hi> reply'd the Marchioneſs, <hi>and cannot find in me that calmneſs of Spirits, which is required in the explication of ſuch Dreams. In my Opinion, Madam,</hi> then ſaid the Woman, <hi>it
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:135663:283"/> is ſo eaſie, that you cannot but fall of your ſelf upon the ſenſe of your Dream, and as ſilly as I am, I would undertake to give you the meaning of it, from what I have ſometimes heard your Husband ſay to you, when he has been in a paſſion, but that I know my diſtance.</hi> The Marchioneſs having brought her to this that ſhe would have her, ſhe call'd to her louder than before, ſaying, <hi>I give thee free liberty to ſay what thou wilt; and I do aſſure thee before-hand that I ſhall not take any thing ill, that thou ſhalt ſay, but on the contrary, be very well pleas'd at it; and I have a moſt long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſire to hear thee, therefore be free, go on, ſpeak boldly and loud, that I may hear thee perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. In obedience to your commands, Madam,</hi> then ſaid the Woman, <hi>I muſt tell you, that I have heard often a learned man ſay, that frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the cauſe of ſuch Dreams as yours is, is when the mind being fill'd with certain Ideas of ſuch things as are of neareſt concerns to us, our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation works upon thoſe things which diſturb us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in our ſleep: This is the reaſon, Madam, I think that your fancy has repreſented to you, in a Dream, though under ſome diſguiſe, thoſe things which moſt poſſeſs your thoughts when awake. This is very well begun,</hi> ſaid the Marchioneſs, <hi>and I prithee go on, and ſpeak louder yet; I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeen the Marqueſs, Madam,</hi> continued the Woman, <hi>in a paſſion againſt your ſelf, againſt a certain Pilgrim, whom he ſays is ſome diſguis'd Perſon, and againſt the Governour of</hi> Barcellona <hi>and his Lady, for taking that Pilgrims part, and why may not out of theſe things be collected matter ſufficient for your Dream, Madam? I like what thou ſayeſt ſo well,</hi> reply'd the Marchioneſs, <hi>that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:135663:284"/> I would have thee to particularize it. Well, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> reply'd the Woman, who was proud of her Office, and of being applauded, <hi>ſince that it is your Pleaſure I ſhould, thus I think it may be made out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That Perſon that ſeems to be a Religious man is Father</hi> Andrew. <hi>How! let me hear that again,</hi> ſaid the Marchioneſs, <hi>and ſpeak a little louder, who is it ſayſt thou, Father</hi> Andrew <hi>anſwered the Woman, raiſing her voice; very well,</hi> ſaid the Marchioneſs, <hi>proceed. That Perſon,</hi> continued the Woman, <hi>that appear'd to you like a Cavalier, is the Governour of</hi> Barcellona: <hi>who through the Monſters inſtigation did caſt the diſguis'd Perſon, who repreſents the Pilgrim, into the Chair: who is that?</hi> ſaid the Marchioneſs: <hi>The Pilgrim, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, who was put in Priſon: This is very well,</hi> ſaid the Marchioneſs, <hi>prithee go on; and who was the Woman?</hi> Donna Barbara, Donna Barbara, <hi>Madam,</hi> continued the Woman: <hi>All this is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry juſt all this while: But then, who is repreſented by the Monſter,</hi> ſaid the Marchioneſs. <hi>That, Madam,</hi> reply'd the Woman, <hi>muſt be ſome body, whoſe paſſions are monſtrous, and</hi>— here the Marchioneſs finding her to Stagger a little, to incourage her, ſaid, <hi>What thou haſt done for me, in the interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my Dream, has given much eaſe to my troubled Spirits, for which I will be bountiful to thee, and if thou canſt but give me as true an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Monſter as thou haſt done of the reſt, it will give me full ſatisfaction: I hope, Madam,</hi> reply'd the Woman, after ſhe had thank'd the Marchioneſs, <hi>that you will diſpence me from ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more plainly:</hi> and there ſhe ſtopt again; at which the Marchioneſs call'd to her to come near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:135663:284"/> and gave her ſome Gold, which had ſuch an influence over her Spirits and Tongue, that ſhe had no ſooner felt the weight of it in the palm of her hand, but that ſhe ſaid, <hi>Well, Madam, ſince you will have it ſo, and that you promiſe not to be angry with me; I will tell you, that your Husband, Madam, was repreſented, by the Monſter, How's that?</hi> ſaid the Marchioneſs, ſeeming very well pleas'd at it, <hi>my Husband? Yes, Madam, your Husband's the Monſter,</hi> ſaid the Woman: <hi>That's very right in truth,</hi> ſaid the Marchioneſs, <hi>his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious paſſions, bitter expreſſions, ſevere threatnings, curſes, railings, jealouſies, prying into all my acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and liſtening, and lurking up and down like a Spie, does deſerve no better, than to be term'd Monſtrous, and Beaſtly, and that he ſhould be ſerv'd as he was at</hi> Barcellona. <hi>I muſt confeſs, Madam,</hi> reply'd the Woman, who was willing to ſay ſomething to the Marchioneſs for her Gold, <hi>that he is ſomewhat too diſtruſtful and jealous, and that on the condition that it would change his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, I could wiſh that he was ſerv'd ſo again, or as that Perſon was, that we heard to roar ſo ſtrangely, a while ſince, which People do judge to be ſome Eve dropper catch'd in a Trap.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At theſe words the Marqueſs not being able to contain himſelf any longer, ruſh'd into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. I thank you, Madam, ſaid he to his Wife, for your kind wiſhes; and you, houſewife, ſaid he to the Woman, you ſhall immediately go where you may talk of Governours, Father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> Pilgrims, yes, and of Monſters too, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, taking her by the Arm, and ſtinging her out of the Chamber, thou ſhalt not lye under my roof this night; and having call'd <hi>Zora</hi> to ſtay
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:135663:285"/> with his Wife, he preſently went out of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber after the Woman.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zora,</hi> being enter'd, did ſhut the Door, and came with a chearful countenance up to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs, who receiv'd her as joyfully: I think ſaid ſhe, that we have given him enough on't, to put him out of the humour of hearkning this good while. I believe that you have touch'd him to the quick, Madam, reply'd <hi>Zora,</hi> he is in ſuch a paſſion; but I would not truſt him however; for it is ſo natural to him, or at leaſt he has got ſuch an habit of hearkning, that he can no more leave it, than any of his other vices. But now let me know the reaſon of this change of Station, ſaid the Marchioneſs: That, Madam, reply'd <hi>Zora,</hi> is as Comical a Story, as you have heard, with that ſhe told the Marchioneſs the Tale of the Tub, which did exceedingly pleaſe her; who in her turn acquainted <hi>Zora</hi> of her feigned Dream, and that <hi>Camille</hi> had viſited her that Evening, in her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but that her fellow Servant had watch'd him ſo narrowly, that he had not had the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſpeaking one word in private; therefore, continued ſhe, you muſt make ſome excuſe or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to morrow to go out, that you may meet with him, and poſitively conclude amongſt you, of ſome immediate courſe of freeing me; for now this man is ſo nettled, that he will not ſtay any longer, but will have me away, and Heaven knows where, and how he will diſpoſe of me. Madam, reply'd <hi>Zora,</hi> your fears are not ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; for he has declar'd ſo much to me; and I fear that ſhould he remove you from hence, we ſhould loſe all hopes of releaſing you; but we ſhall find ſome way to ſave him that labour, ſo ſoon
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:135663:285"/> as I meet with the Pilgrim, and Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> which ſhall be to morrow in the Forenoon: Your Husband, Madam, has been ſorely bruis'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhe, and though his Curioſity, and his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will not let him feel it at preſent, doubtleſs but tomorrow morning he will be ſore and but of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as to be willing to keep his Bed ſome time longer than ordinary; I will take that opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to go to them, and if he ſhould want me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I return, it will be your care to excuſe me, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of having employ'd me about ſome buſineſs: That care I will take upon me, reply'd the Marchioneſs, be you but diligent as to the reſt; for I very much fear the conſequences of his removing me from hence: You will do well, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid <hi>Zora,</hi> to go to Bed, to avoid your Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands railing, which he will forbear to Night, if he thinks you aſleep when he comes to Bed, and that he may lye the longer in the morning, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe your patience with his railing. The hopes that I have, <hi>Zora,</hi> reply'd the Marchioneſs, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing e're long freed from all his unſufferable extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagances, will make me to endure it, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary patience. With this the Marchioneſs went to Bed, where ſhe was but juſt laid, when the Marqueſs came in full ſtor'd with Reproaches and Injuries; but <hi>Zora</hi> whiſpering to him, that ſhe was now aſleep and that he had better ſtay till morning, and then read her a Lecture: after he had grumbled ſome few words between his Teeth, he told <hi>Zora</hi> that he was not very well, and ſo he preſently went to Bed.</p>
                  <p>In the morning he made divers attempts, of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging his Choler with a whole volly of rude expreſſions upon his Lady, but ſhe as often did
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:135663:286"/> ſhun the brunt by feigning her ſelf aſleep; yet at laſt, he was grown ſo full of his Venom, that he muſt vent it, or burſt; he therefore began to thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a peal in her Ears, that ſhe was forc'd to make ſome replies in her own defence: amongſt the reſt, What is it you would have, ſaid the Marchioneſs, what cauſe or reaſon have you to uſe me thus, continually? What is happen'd to you of late? And what have I done, to cauſe you to treat me as you do? I wonder with what Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence you can ask theſe queſtions, reply'd the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs; it is nothing with you then, it ſeems, to be reviling and abuſing of your Husband during an hour or two, with his Servant? And to wiſh him any thing that tends to his diſhonour? That Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon reply'd the Marchioneſs, (who was reſolv'd to give it him home) that is ſo little careful of his honour, as to proſtitute it to the appetite of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unruly paſſion, need not fear that a few words from an injur'd Woman ſhould prejudice it: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall they, reply'd the Marqueſs, for that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as proſtitute as you ſpeak it, is, and ſhall be above your reach, and <hi>I</hi> hope to keep it ſo; but in the mean time, it ill becomes you to controul your Husbands actions, to beſpatter them with your ſcurrilous Tongue, and to wiſh that ſome ill For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune might attend them, while that they are in order to preſerve that honour, which you ſo much endeavour to deſtroy. That which you call the deſtroying of your Honour, reply'd the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is rather a deſire of its preſervation, if it were rightly underſtood; it is that intereſt that <hi>I</hi> ſhould have in it, were it not render'd unworthy of me by thoſe baſe, low, and obſcene ways, with which you pretend to preſerve it; that makes me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:135663:286"/> it ſhould not be ſo vilified, but that it ſhould ſhine in its full luſtre, without the leaſt Eclipſe of a low, or cloudy Action, to hide its brightneſs. Whatſoever <hi>I</hi> do, reply'd the Marqueſs, is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my Honour from that darkneſs, which you would caſt over it, being in all reſpects leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; <hi>I</hi> think it reaſonable to prefer ſome ſmall momentary Eclipſes, to that horror of Eternal Darkneſs which you would caſt upon it. <hi>I</hi> could wiſh, reply'd the Marchioneſs, that you would let me know, what you mean by that Eternal Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that <hi>I</hi> would caſt upon your honour? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect but on your own actions, reply'd the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, and you will not be long without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it. If to deſire the ſame liberty as other Perſons enjoy, reply'd the Marchioneſs; nay, if to endeavour to attain to it, is a crime of ſuch a nature, as to blemiſh your honour ſo irreparably, as you mention, <hi>I</hi> freely declare unto you, that
<hi>I</hi> ſhall ever be guilty of the ſame error. And <hi>I</hi> do declare to you, anſwered the Marqueſs, that <hi>I</hi> will break your meaſures within theſe three days, if it is poſſible, by conveying you to ſuch a place, where you ſhall not be affrighted at the ſight of new Faces; in a word, Madam, <hi>I</hi> will ſet my honour in ſafety, by ſecuring of you, who does endeavour with the utmoſt of your power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it: And <hi>I</hi> will commit my ſelf, reply'd the Marchioneſs, unto the protection of Heaven, and ſo do your worſt; and after this, ſhe turn'd her from the Marqueſs, who would fain have gone on in this wrangling diſcourſe, but finding that he, could not get one word more from her, do what he could; after ſome little time having call'd for <hi>Zora,</hi> and ſhe not coming, he did riſe of himſelf,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:135663:287"/> but did not ſtir out of the Chamber, being oblig'd to ſupply the abſent Guardians places.</p>
                  <p>It was then about ten of the Clock, the evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of his late diſaſter having oblig'd him to lye longer in Bed than uſually, he was looking out of the Window, when he was diverted by a little Dog of the Marchioneſs's, who was playing with ſome Papers upon the Floor, which Papers he had met with under her Pillow; the Marqueſs did preſently deprive the poor Dog from that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light which he took, in tumbling them about; and having look'd upon them: Yes, Madam, ſaid he to his Wife, theſe are ſome of thoſe means which you uſe, in order to preſerve my honour; then looking on them, both in Verſe and Proſe, continued he, all this you call but the endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to attain unto the ſame liberty which other Perſons enjoy, and theſe are ſome of thoſe ſmall errors that you will ever be guilty of. The Marchioneſs fretted at the Heart, did not anſwer one word: Shall <hi>I</hi> read them to you, they will doubtleſs pleaſe you much better, than whatſoever <hi>I</hi> can ſay to you; with that he began to read, but preſently <hi>Zora</hi> coming in, Oh! <hi>Zora,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, my Wife's little Dog, more kind than her ſelf, or Woman, has made me partaker of ſome curious pieces, which <hi>I</hi> would not for any thing but that <hi>I</hi> had ſeen, for <hi>I</hi> am a great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of ſuch excellent things; you ſhall hear them: then he began again to read thoſe Papers, which were thoſe that <hi>Camille</hi> had preſented to the Marchioneſs, are not theſe very fine things, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, after he had read ſome of them; here is mention made of Kiſſes, on Hands and Lips too, full of Nectar; nay, the very quinteſſence
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:135663:287"/> was extracted from them: no doubt, Madam, continued he, addreſſing himſelf to his Wife, that you did your part alſo, and that you and your Minion, did ſpread inſide Lips, and traffick'd li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoriſh Tongues, in order to thoſe extractions here mention'd; to all this the Marchioneſs did not anſwer one word, which made <hi>Zora,</hi> that durſt not be too forward neither in excuſing her Lady, ſay, but where did this Dog get them? Where had he them? Where has he been? Where has he been? ſaid the Marqueſs; Where had he them? In your Miſtreſſes Boſome, that's the Caskenet in which ſhe preſerves ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Jewels: Has not the Dog been out of the Chamber this Morning? ſaid <hi>Zora.</hi> No, no, anſwer'd the Marqueſs, he needed not to go ſo far for them, they were nearer at hand, I can aſſure you: Then he continued reading the reſt of the Papers, after which he fell into this raging fit. And is it come to that? Is it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for me to make uſe of any thing whatſoever, but that it muſt turn to this Damnable Pilgrim's advantage? And muſt you be ſick, continued he, ſpeaking to his Wife, only to give him the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of viſiting you, under the notion of a Doctor? and to apply ſuch Lip-Salve for your Cure? Is it impoſſible then, to find out ſuch a place as is able to contain him, with all the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that Chains, Bolts, Shackles, Bars, and Stone Walls can afford? But that notwithſtanding all my Cares, my watchful Cares, I muſt learn that he quenches his laſcivious heats in your Boſome? Well, what cannot be done one way, ſhall be done the other. Thou ſhame of thy Sex, continued he, take leave of the whole world, for I proteſt by
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:135663:288"/> all that is ſacred, to ſequeſter thee from it, with all the diligence that I can poſſibly uſe; But firſt I will have my full revenge on this incarnate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, I will tear his heart out of his body before you; yes, I will preſent you with it, you ſhall enjoy it. Then walking very faſt about the Chamber, and ſometimes ſtopping on the ſudden, ſometime running haſtily out of the Chamber, then preſently in again; in fine, ſhewing a thouſand irreſolutions, with which his mind was agitated at once: at laſt he ſtood ſtock ſtill in the middle of the Room, holding the Papers with one Hand, and biting the Nails of the other; after ſome time he came out of his ſerious thoughts again, and thus he ſpake,
<hi>Zora:</hi> Do you not move from hence till my return; I will firſt go to the Priſon, and know how it comes to paſs that this Priſoner is releas'd; I ſhall not be long, ſtir not upon your Life, then going towards the Chamber Door, he ſuddenly turns back again, ſaying: No, I will ſend for the Jaylor here; I will not ſtir from hence, till I have my revenge fully accompliſh'd. <hi>Zora,</hi> continued he, call ſome Servants up quickly, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch:
<hi>Zora</hi> went out, and preſently return'd, with Servants after her: The Marqueſs calls one in, and ſends him to the Jaylor to come immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him, and to bring along with him the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner; that Servant being gone about it, he calls another, and ſends to fetch the Doctor to his Wife, who was very ill on the ſudden, telling him that he ſhould bring him with him immediately, for his Wife was very ill, and could not live long; but the Fellow telling him that he knew not where the Doctor liv'd: the Marqueſs in a paſſion, bid him call one that knew; the Fellow goes forth, and returns preſently, ſaying, that there was but
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:135663:288"/> one that knew where he liv'd, and that he had ſent him to the Priſon. All theſe little obſtacles did ſtill inrage the Marqueſs the more; but being reſolv'd to clear all doubts, and take his full revenge, he tells <hi>Zora,</hi> that ſhe muſt go and fetch the Doctor, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering whether ſhe knew where he liv'd, telling her that he would watch there himſelf till her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: <hi>Zora</hi> being very glad of the employ, that ſhe might prevent all miſchiefs, by her giving <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mille</hi> notice of the diſcovery; was going forth, when the Marqueſs cry'd, yet hold, peradventure that he is but the Pilgrim's Agent, made uſe of to convey the Papers and ſecret Meſſages; and it is on the immediate cauſe of all my troubles, that my revenge muſt fall with that ſeverity; then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a little pauſe: Yet go, continued he, for theſe Papers ſpeak plain enough, that the two Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters belong but to one Perſon; but what then, were they gone, and ſacrific'd to my reſentments, are there not more Men? And is not my Honour ſtill in the ſame danger, ſo long as that Woman is Breathing? She muſt—ſhe ſhall—then after another pauſe, breaking off his diſcourſe by ſnatches, as if what he would ſay were too, cruel to be ſpoken aloud: <hi>Zora,</hi> ſaid he, ſtay, no, go, and get this Robber of my Honour to come and receive his due reward; I ſhall look him more carefully in the Face, than I did in the dark, when I had no ſuſpition: go continued he; and ſend me ſome-body here mean time: <hi>Zora</hi> very glad of the employ, did preſently go, for fear that he ſhould once again change his reſolutions, and ſhe ſent ſome more of the Servants to him. The inraged Marqueſs commanded two of them to ſtand at the Chamber Door, and not to move from thence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of immediate Death, till he return'd, nor
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:135663:289"/> to let his Wife go out, if ſhe ſhould attempt it, and not being contented with that, he took the Key along with him; he preſently ran into his Cloſet, out of which having taken a brace of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols, and a long Stilletto, he preſently return'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; he then gave order to two Servants to ſtand at the Street-Door, charging them, that ſo ſoon as they ſhould ſee the Doctor come into the Houſe, they ſhould ſhut him in, and not let him go out again, till he gave them order; two more Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants he plac'd at his Wife's Chamber door, with order to ſhut it ſo ſoon as the Doctor ſhould be come in; and two more he ſet in his Wife's Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, charging them to be ready to come into the Chamber with their Swords drawn, ſo ſoon as he ſhould give the word; having thus plac'd his Centuries, he walk'd up and down the Chamber, after ſo ſtrange a manner, with ſuch ſtrange acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and muttering to himſelf ſtrange things, that it might eaſily be gueſt at the fury which did poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs his Soul.</p>
                  <p>Mean time the poor Marchioneſs, who had not ſpoken one word all this time, thinking that it would be to no purpoſe to make any excuſes, lay agitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with divers horrid fears; the leaſt of which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been ſufficient to have broken any heart, leſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with innocency and courage than hers. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſhe did reflect on what her Husbands paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had forc'd out of his Mouth, which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned no leſs than her Life; at other times ſhe fear'd, having obſerv'd with what readineſs <hi>Zora</hi> was gone to fetch <hi>Camille,</hi> leſt that ſhe being affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his rage, ſhould bring him along with her; and ſometimes too ſhe fear'd, leſt he ſhould come of his own accord, before that <hi>Zora</hi> ſhould come
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:135663:289"/> to him to give him notice of the imminent danger; and in a word, ſhe fear'd more for him, than for her ſelf; with a thouſand ſuch fears her mind was poſſeſs'd, when on a ſudden ſhe heard a great out cry in the Houſe; the Marqueſs, who heard it likewiſe, did ſend one to know what was the matter, who preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd with thoſe two that had been plac'd at the Street-door, who were bleeding, they told the Marqueſs, that the Doctor had enter'd the Door, but that as they were ſhutting it after him, he diſtruſting ſomething, it had made him to retire, but they oppoſing him, he had ſnatch'd a Sword out of their hands, and with it forc'd his way through them, into the Street again; at this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation the Marqueſs tore his Hairs, and drawing his Sword, had certainly run it through him that ſtood neareſt him, had he not diligently eſcap'd it, which furious action did make the reſt alſo to ſtand alſo at a further diſtance. I want words to expreſs, all that the height of the greateſt rage ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, did make the Marqueſs to ſay and act, therefore I ſhall paſs it by; to tell you, that while he was in the midſt of his fury, <hi>Zora</hi> came into the Chamber; ſhe having miſs'd of <hi>Camille,</hi> had left her meſſage with Father
<hi>Andrew,</hi> with an account of all that had paſs'd, in as few words as ſhe could, that ſhe might haſten back to prevent <hi>Camille's</hi> getting into the Marqueſs's Houſe, who was gone forth in order to go there, after that he had call'd at <hi>Don Alphonſo's;</hi> but ſhe coming near home, had learn'd what had happen'd, by a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that was running for a Chiruregon to dreſs thoſe that <hi>Camille</hi> had wounded; all this was very well ſhe thought, but for fear that the Marqueſs
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:135663:290"/> being diſappointed of his revenge on the Pilgrim, ſhould in his paſſion diſcharge it all on his Wife: So ſoon as ſhe was enter'd, ſhe made ſigns unto the Marqueſs, as if ſhe had ſomething to ſay to him in private, he preſently ſent the Servants out and went into the Cloſet, where <hi>Zora</hi> followed him, after ſhe had thrown a piece of Paper unto the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs, in which was written: <hi>Fear nothing.</hi> She told the Marqueſs, that though ſhe had fail'd of the Pilgrim, ſhe had met with a Perſon as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as he, and that was Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> that finding a Door ſhut ſhe had look'd through the Key hole, and there ſhe had ſeen and heard the Fryar, who with half a dozen more were contriving to take the Marchioneſs away by force at a Night, or upon the Road, when ever he ſhould offer to remove her; that ſhe underſtood that they had made many Friends in that City that were as willing as able, to ſerve the Pilgrim in that wicked deſign; and that therefore he was to lay his paſſion aſide, and think what he had beſt to do, to prevent their deſigns. Do, ſaid the Marqueſs, in as great a fury as ever, I will help them in it, they ſhall have her, I will beſtow her upon her Minion, my ſelf, I'll on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keep her Heart to my ſelf, and they ſhall ſhare her Carcaſs amongſt them; then preſently after a little pauſe, fetching a great ſigh, from the bottom of his Heart, but why ſhould I deſign ſo fooliſhly, this would be to ſerve them according to their own deſires, the Pilgrim has had her Heart long ſince, and it is only for her body that all this is; here he made another pauſe, which gave time to <hi>Zora</hi> to ſay, <hi>Sir, there is no time to loſe, ſpend it not therefore in vain reflections; once more let me perſuade you to lay aſide all paſſion, and to think of what is to be
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:135663:290"/> done to ſecure the Marchioneſs from all their attempts: I have thought on't,</hi> reply'd the Marqueſs haſtily, <hi>ſhe ſhall dye, and then there's an end of all, of all my miſeries at once, yea, and of me and all: Heavens forbid,</hi> ſaid <hi>Zora, Pray, Sir,—What wouldſt thou have me to do then?</hi> reply'd the Marqueſs, interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her in a milder tone? <hi>I will tell you, Sir,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Zora, give out to your Servants immediately, that you will be gone from this City in the Morning early, that all things ſhould be got ready to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with all the Oſtentation that may be, that the noiſe of it may be ſpread about the Town, eſpecially about the Confederates Quarters, ſo that they may know of it, and provide for the taking of the Marchioneſs on the Road; mean time let a Litter be got in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, wherein the Marchioneſs ſhould be convey'd in the dead of the Night, by force if ſhe makes reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; I ſhall take care to prevent her from making any noiſe, or getting out, and let the Litter be driven quite another way, than it ſhould have been given out that you intended to go, while that ye follow with your Mule; no doubt but this will deceive the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim and his Friends, who certainly will be upon the Road that way that you have given out you would go to intercept the Marchioneſs, mean time ſhe will have been convey'd to ſome other place of ſafety. This, Sir,</hi> continued ſhe, <hi>I have been thinking of, as I came home; the apprehenſions of ſome ſudden at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, having ſet me upon it; for now that your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies are ſtrong and powerful, when they find that you ſtir not from hence, they will attempt any thing even here, and Heaven knows what they may not do, having the Marchioneſs always ready to aſſiſt them. And now, Sir, I leave to your prudence to judge, whether what I have propos'd, is not reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:135663:291"/> and the products of an Heart that is wholly devoted to your Service.</hi> My Dear, and Faithful, <hi>Zora,</hi> reply'd the Marqueſs, I can never thank thee ſufficiently for the cares which thouh aſt in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, and I ſhall never forget it; I find all that thou haſt ſaid to be very good, and to proceed from a faithful Heart, but I will, or rather we will with deliberation, Methodiſe it ſo that our deſign ſhall not be capable of failing. I am of opinion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as you have diſcreetly propos'd, that a Litter ſhould this day be got in readineſs, but I would have it to be convey'd a little way out of Town towards the place that I intend to go to, which is <hi>Tolledo,</hi> ſo privately that no notice may be taken of it, and in the Evening I will take thy Miſtreſs and thy ſelf in a Coach, and we will be carried thither, where you two ſhall get into the Litter, and I will follow upon my Mule, none of the Servants know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this but one that I dare confide in, who ſhall be buſied with the reſt of his Fellows in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things ready for to be going in the morning, to ſome other place that I ſhall appoint them to meet me at: by theſe means we ſhall get a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable way in our Journey, before any notice is taken of it, and the Villains will be fruſtrated of their expectation to morrow, when they ſet upon my empty Coach, and my Men, and the further to deceive them, my Servants ſhall tell them that we did not deſign to ſtir forth till the Evening, though we had ſent them before, for this will make them to deſiſt any further purſuit at that time, in hopes of meeting with us at Night. This is ſuch a way, reply'd <hi>Zora,</hi> as would be infallible, of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your Wife ſafe from hence, if we could but be provided with a Litter and Mule drivers to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:135663:291"/> it without noiſe. There's the ſtreſs of the whole buſineſs, reply'd the Marqueſs, neither know I whom to truſt as to that; and I believe that I muſt go about it my ſelf. I would not have you to leave the Marchioneſs one moment, reply'd
<hi>Zora,</hi> you have ſo affrighted all your Servants, that none dares to appear before you, but ſhe that would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture a thouſand Lives to ſerve you; what do I know but that at this very preſent there is ſome correſpondency, between your Wife and her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates? Sould they attempt any thing in your abſence, either by the Garden, to get her out of the Window, ſhe being as ready to go, as they to receive her, who ſhould oppoſe them? where would be any aid? I ſhould quickly be diſpatch'd, and then the booty would be their own; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think it very neceſſary for you to remain by her, till we all three are going in the Evening: That which thou haſt ſaid is very true, ſaid the Marqueſs; but then how ſhall we get this Litter and Men convey'd ſecretly another way out of Town, than we muſt ſeem to go? Let that be my care, Sir, ſaid <hi>Zora,</hi> I have ſome acquaintance here in Town, that ſhall do that buſineſs for us, I will go inſtantly to ſet them about it; but ſtay, reply'd the Marqueſs, till I have been in my Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet to fetch out ſome writings, and then I will not move from her Chamber till thy return. After this, the Marqueſs went out of the Chamber to his Cloſet, which gave time to <hi>Zora,</hi> to tell the Marchioneſs, that ſhe ſhould fear nothing, that ſhe had appeas'd her Husband for the preſent, and that that Night ſhould be the laſt of her miſery; that ſhe would inform their Friends of all the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs before ſhe return'd, take their advice likewiſe,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:135663:292"/> and of all make an abſolute concluſion, which ſhe would bring her back in writing, that ſhe might know what part ſhe had to act, and not be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd; this did
<hi>Zora</hi> deliver with ſuch a chearful countenance, kiſſing the Marchioneſs's Hand, that ſhe was very much comforted by it: <hi>Zora</hi> was after that adviſing her Lady to riſe, and pack up all her Jewels and other things of value by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when the Marqueſs return'd into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to whom <hi>Zora</hi> ſaid, I have been perſuading, my Lady to riſe, and to prepare for her Journey, but ſhe will not believe that ſhe has need to make ſuch haſte. No! reply'd the Marqueſs; yet ſhe may be certain that ſhe ſhall not lye one Night longer in this place; therefore let her riſe, and pack up her things her ſelf, if ſhe will, for I have other employs for you, and now go about what I have ſent you to do:
<hi>Zora</hi> preſently went about her buſineſs; the Marqueſs employ'd himſelf about making up and examining of Accounts, while the Marchioneſs went into her Cloſet, where ſhe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd her ſelf in diſpoſing of her Jewels privately about her, with other things of concerns, and ſtuffing up of thoſe Boxes and Caſes, that they were uſually carried in, with other things of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no value: Thus the Marqueſs in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, having continually one Eye on the Cloſet Window, and the Marchioneſs in the Cloſet, did remain till <hi>Zora</hi> return'd, without ſpeaking one word to one another, to the Ladies great ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zora</hi> was not long before ſhe got to <hi>Camille</hi>'s, whom ſhe inform'd of what ſhe had done, and that the Marchioneſs had a knowledge of it: She likewiſe gave him an account of his fair eſcape,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:135663:292"/> which he had made out of the Marqueſs's Houſe, while that the Marqueſs had ſent her on purpoſe to bring him to his inevitable Death. How that he had ſworn to tear his Heart out of his Body, and to give it to her: he need not put himſelf to that trouble reply'd
<hi>Camille,</hi> I have long ſince ſav'd him that labour, in preſenting it my ſelf to her, in a condition to do her more Service, and therefore more acceptable. Let us loſe no time now, ſaid Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> and let it not be ſaid, that this Woman has done all her ſelf, but let us act our parts likewiſe. Then <hi>Zora</hi> told them, that there was to be got out of hand a Litter, Mules, and Mule drivers, that were to be convey'd very privately, at ſome ſmall diſtance from the City, at a place which ſhe nam'd. That ſhall be my charge, reply'd the good Father, and let me alone to deceive that wicked Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> and that abominable Pilgrim; and be certain, that within three hours at fartheſt it ſhall be at the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: Yes, but where will you find truſty men to attend it? reply'd <hi>Zora:</hi> Are not here two, anſwer'd the brisk Fryar? how many would you have? And for their fidelity to us, I will engage for the one if you will engage for the other, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, addreſſing himſelf to
<hi>Camille;</hi> that will do very well, reply'd <hi>Camille,</hi> and my task ſhall be to diſcharge the Houſe, to provide good Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and to crave the aſſiſtance of my worthy Friend <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> of his Lady, and of his Houſe and Servants, to receive us and our Prize, when we have it. Another thing is to be thought on alſo, ſaid Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> which is, to convey ſomething between the Marqueſs's Mules Feet and her Shooes, that ſhe may fall down right lame
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:135663:293"/> within a little while after that he ſhall be got upon her, which will cauſe him to ſtay behind, while we diligently go on with the Litter. Better and better ſtill, ſaid <hi>Camille,</hi> I ſee that we ſhall bring it to ſomething at laſt. This will do, ſaid <hi>Zora,</hi> and I think that we need no further to conſult a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. No, no, reply'd Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> and therefore I am gone to get the Litter and all things belonigng to it: And if you pleaſe, Sir, ſaid <hi>Zora</hi> to <hi>Camille,</hi> to write down the reſult of our conſultation, I will inſtantly return and give it the Marchioneſs, and tell the Marqueſs, that within theſe two hours there will be a Litter in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, at the place that he has appointed. That I'll ingage for, ſaid Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> and away went he:
<hi>Camille</hi> having writ the Note of advice, did give it to <hi>Zora,</hi> who return'd home with it, and <hi>Camille</hi> having diſcharg'd the Houſe, went to his Friend
<hi>Alphonſo,</hi> who he did very eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage and his Lady likewiſe, to ſerve him in that buſineſs, ſhe highly praiſing his reſolution, of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Marchioneſs into her hands, when that ſhe were at his whole diſpoſal; and <hi>Camille</hi> having told them the time and place that they ſhould meet them on the Road, where <hi>Alphonſo</hi> aſſur'd him he would not fail to be exactly; he return'd home, to wait for Father <hi>Andrew's</hi> return, which was preſently after, with a Litter, in which there were two Suits of Cloaths, to dreſs himſelf and <hi>Camille</hi> in, like Mule-drivers. He bid one of the Perſons that were come along with him, to follow him up ſtairs, where he ſhould receive his Money; ſo ſoon as he came into the Chamber, he call'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Camille</hi> to pay the Money, which he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed for,
<hi>Camille</hi> did readily do it, and went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:135663:293"/> the Litter to the place appointed, where Father <hi>Andrew</hi> follow'd; they were no ſooner got thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but they ſent back the Mule-drivers, and accoutred themſelves in thoſe Cloaths which the Father had brought, which made a couple of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Varlets of them, in which poſture they wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Marqueſs's coming.</p>
                  <p>While theſe things had been tranſacting abroad, the Marqueſs had been examining the Pilgrim, which the Jaylor had brought to him according to his Orders; at the very ſight of him, he found him not to be that Pilgrim which he meant, and at laſt having found his miſtake, and the cauſe of it, through his examining of every circumſtance, he diſcharg'd the follow, giving him a piece of Money for to make him amends for the wrong which he had done him, with which he went his way very well ſatisfy'd, that he had got his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at laſt, with a good ſum of Money.</p>
                  <p>Mean time <hi>Zora</hi> was return'd home, where ſhe had ſome opportunity, during the Marqueſs's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the Pilgrim, to give the Marchioneſs the Note, and a full account of all their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the Marchioneſs was very well pleas'd with what <hi>Zora</hi> did tell her, whereby divers ſcruples which had riſen in her mind, were remov'd: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after the Marqueſs came into the Chamber, and <hi>Zora</hi> told him, that there would be a Litter at the time and place appointed, with which he ſeem'd very well ſatisfy'd: The reſt of that day the Marqueſs did ſpend in giving his laſt orders to his Servants, and to get thoſe things together which he intended for his preſent uſes.</p>
                  <p>Having diſpatch'd all other buſineſſes, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to his Wife's Chamber, where he bid his
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:135663:294"/> Wife and <hi>Zora</hi> to prepare to be going within an hour, it being already towards the Evening. This made <hi>Zora</hi> to buſſel about, and to fit the Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs in a travelling poſture; at laſt, the Coach which the Marqueſs had appointed came to the Door, which made him to call upon his Wife once again; he led her to it, where he plac'd her, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, he and <hi>Zora</hi> went in it; it was dark, and he had ſo muffled up both his Wife and <hi>Zora</hi> in Cloaks, that no body could well diſcern, if they were men or women; in a ſhort time after they came to the place, where the Litter was waiting for them, and his Mule likewiſe, which he had ſent before, whoſe Feet had been ſtuff'd, by the two new Mule drivers, with things more uneaſie, than ſhe could well indure. So ſoon as the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs did ſee the Litter, and having haſtily plac'd his Wife in it, and <hi>Zora</hi> by her, he made it up himſelf, and bidding the Mule-drivers go on, he got upon his Mule and follow'd.</p>
                  <p>They had not gone far before the Marqueſs's Mule began to halt, but he put her on ſtill, till at laſt ſhe could, or would not go any further; he did what he could to force her to it, but all in vain, for at laſt ſhe fairly laid her ſelf down, which oblig'd the Marqueſs to alight, and call after the Mule-drivers to ſtay, but they impatient to be at that place where they were expected by <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> and his Lady, they went on the faſter, he run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter crying as loud as he could for them to ſtay, but the uncivil Mule-drivers, did not ſo much as once look back; on the contrary the louder he call'd, and the faſter he did run, the faſter they drove, till they came to a turning, where they met with their Friends; preſently was the Marchioneſs ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:135663:294"/> out of the Litter by <hi>Camille,</hi> and led to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo</hi>'s Coach, where reſigning her into his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Hands: <hi>Thus, Madam,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>do I part with you, according to your deſires, and my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, into the Hand of this moſt worthy Lady; and now, Madam, you are at your own diſpoſal;</hi> there was no time for longer Compliments, the Marchioneſs only ſaid: <hi>Now I find that you are truly generous, and that I have not deceiv'd my ſelf: Camille</hi> gave her not time to ſay more, for he preſently put off his diſguiſe, and having got a Horſe, he and <hi>Alphonſo</hi> did ride by the Coach ſide, while it carried the two Ladies, <hi>Zora,</hi> and Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> another way into the City a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, where they all got into <hi>Alphonſo</hi>'s Houſe by the back Door.</p>
                  <p>Mean time the poor Marqueſs did continue his hallowing and calling after the Mule-drivers, though he had long ſince loſt the ſight of them, and did trudge as he could after them; but the Gallants were gone with their Booty long before he did overtake the empty Litter, which the Mules (being left at their own diſpoſal) had carried to a little by-place, cloſe by the great Road, where they were biting upon a little Graſs, which they had met with; ſo that when he came up wearied and almoſt ſpent, he preſently look'd into it, but finding no body there, nor any where thereabouts, he fairly enter'd it to reſt himſelf, never minding where the Mules did carry him; and they having eaten that little of Graſs that they had met with, they went on, as by chance they had turn'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which prov'd to be the ready way back to the City.</p>

                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:135663:295"/>The poor Marqueſs being thus carried, he knew not whither, nor did he care to know, with a very flow pace: He had both time and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, to reflect on all his misfortunes, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on the greateſt of all, the loſs of his Wife; concluding with himſelf, that the whole world did conſent to his miſeries. What to do, which way to go, or what to reſolve upon, he knew not; therefore letting the Mules go which way they pleas'd, he began to conſider with himſelf, what was the reaſon that he was ſo unfortunate above all other men: amongſt many things which came to his Fancy on this account, the great ſeverity with which he had us'd his Wife, by giving too much ſcope unto his paſſions, did not a little perplex him, which might be the cauſe that ſhe had hearkened after any deſigns that had been propos'd to her, of freeing her ſelf from it, which otherwiſe perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture ſhe had refus'd: No, no, then would he ſay again, I muſt not charge my ſelf with a fault that is wholly hers; thoſe moſt laſcivious papers which I did ſee ſo lately, by meer acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, do but too well expreſs her inclinations; yet ſhe did not write them, continued he; then after a little pauſe, but ſhe receiv'd them, and gave them harbour in her own Bed; and it is conſequently to be believ'd, that ſhe own'd them, approv'd of them, and gave a ſilent conſent to all the ill that was contain'd in them: At this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection he made a great ſigh, and remain'd a while ſilent, after which, he again broke out in this manner: <hi>But when I firſt had her, and that ſhe did yet enjoy ſome moments of liberty, I could never tax nor accuſe her of any the leaſt correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency imaginable with any man; neither could I
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:135663:295"/> with all the exacteſt inquiſition that I could poſſibly uſe, learn that ſhe ever had any publick, or private and particular converſe with any Perſon; ſo that this Pilgrim which now poſſeſſes her, is perhaps known to her but of late, and by meer accident, and ſhe perceiving him to be a man of good meen and parts; why might not ſhe wiſh that he might know of her hard reſtraint, and deſire that he might relieve her out of it; and where is that man that would refuſe her; ſhe in all this may have aim'd but at liberty; and notwithſtanding what hopes ſoever he may build upon, as he expreſs'd in his writing: She might have nobler thoughts, and ſuch as might defeat all his ill deſigns: Yea, but thoſe Kiſſes,</hi> would he ſay again, in a little paſſion, <hi>thoſe laſcivious Kiſſes might have been ſtoln from her,</hi> continued he, as anſwering himſelf, <hi>and I think that they were ſo mention'd, and if ſtoln from her as well as from me, why ſhould I think that ſhe did approve of it, or conſented to the ſtealth?</hi> Thus was he canvaſſing the caſe to himſelf, willing in ſome meaſure to take upon himſelf the cauſe of his Wife's leaving of him, when on the ſudden, a noiſe which he heard, did cauſe him to look out of the Litter, at which the Mules did ſtop, this made him to alight, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he perceiv'd that he was not far from his late Houſe, where his Servants were ſtill, he therefore finding that that noiſe which he had heard, was termining into a quarrel, and that there were Swords already drawn, and being not in a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to mind ſuch things, at that time eſpecially, he made what haſte he could toward his Door; but as he came forth of the Litter, he perceiv'd ſome ſcatter'd Papers in it, which he had the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity to take up, and having given a blow to one
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:135663:296"/> of the Mules, they went on, while he got into his Houſe, where he was receiv'd with as much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as unexpectedneſs, by all his Servants. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently caus'd what they had diſplac'd in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in order to tranſportation, to be laid in order again, and having forbid any of them to ask him any queſtions, he went to Bed, where he read thoſe Papers which he had found in the Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>The one of them was that Letter which the Marchioneſs had torn, not thinking it ſevere enough to rebuke <hi>Camille</hi>'s inſolence, in kiſſing of her; at which the Marqueſs ſeem'd as well pleas'd, as if he had been in hopes of getting his Wife again. The other were indifferent things, yet with ſomething or other ſtill in them, which ſpake more a deſire of being freed from Slavery, than of Love: theſe looſe Papers were, it was likely, ſcatter'd in the haſtily getting out of the Litter, at the time of the ſeiſing on the Marchioneſs; but ſuch as they were, they did ſo confirm him in thoſe thoughts which he inclin'd to have of his Wife's honeſty, that taking hold thereon, he did lay the whole cauſe of his miſcarriage upon himſelf; this with his late miſchance of the Tub, and his over-heating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in running after the Litter, together with the trouble of Spirit which he had upon him, for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging, and in a manner, forcing his Wife to that extremity of leaving him, did preſently caſt him into a violent Feaver, to which a remorce of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divers times had a deſign of poyſoning of her, did not a little contribute.</p>
                  <p>Of truth the Marchioneſs was not ſo much to blame as ſome Perſons might imagin, if all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of her late action was weigh'd with an
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:135663:296"/> equal hand, in the Scale of reaſon: She was young, and endowed with excellent parts of the mind; ſhe had been forc'd by her Parents into the arms of a Perſon for whom ſhe had a natural averſion againſt his Perſon, as well as againſt that moroſe, crabbed, and jealous Nature, which had always been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant in him, that even before Marriage he had made her ſenſible of ſome of its ill effects, and had given out ſuch words within her hearing, as did ſufficiently expreſs how he would uſe her, when once ſhe was his Wife; ſhe had ever ſince that found and felt the ſad effect of thoſe Menaces, without the leaſt cauſe given by her to be ſo ill treated; it was a very hard Fate, for her thus to be ſequeſtred from all converſation, though never ſo modeſt and innocent, to be buried alive in the Arms of a Perſon that ſhe ſo perfectly loath'd, and that far from endeavouring to gain her affection, did uſe her ſo barbarouſly, that it daily did increaſe her averſion againſt him. All that ſhe had done was but to free her ſelf from that intolerable ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry under which ſhe lived moſt miſerably, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever her deliverer did promiſe, or propoſe to himſelf, as a reward for his Services; ſhe knew what was fit for her to give, not to prove ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and what to retain, not to be counted vitious: It is true, that ſhe had thrown her ſelf into the Power of an amorous young man, whom perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture nothing would ſatisfie, but what ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>as not to give, but then ſhe had not the opportunity to pick and chuſe: <hi>Camille</hi> was the only Perſon that had proffer'd his aid, to free her from her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; if ſhe refus'd this, ſhe knew not wheher the Heavens wou'd be ſo kind to her again, as to ſend her any other opportunity; ſhe was gong to b
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:135663:297"/> made yet more miſerable than ever, by that ſevere reſtraint that her too cruel Husband was going to put her under, as he had often given out he would, nay, her Life had often been threatned, though at a diſtance; in all theſe conditions ſhe could not hope to find any relief but in Death; ſhe was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred from all her Friends and Relations, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away into a ſtrange Country, where ſhe had no body to make her complaints unto. In the midſt of all theſe afflictions, <hi>Camille</hi> ſeem'd to her, as ſent from Heaven to be her deliverer; he was a Gentleman, ſo all his actions did ſpeak him, he might for ought that ſhe knew be virtuouſly given as ſoon as vitious, or at leaſt virtue might have ſo much aſcendant over him, that with a modeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance againſt any inordinate deſires, ſhe might aſſiſt that virtue to get the upperhand in him. That in caſe he ſhould prove otherways, ſhe would endeavour to get out of his power, by the aſſiſtance of ſome Religious Perſons, or by giving private notice of it to her Relations, that in the mean time ſhe would ſtave him off with fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and delays, and finally if all that would not do, ſhe was reſolv'd to ſacrifice her Virtue to Death, rather than her body to his laſcivious Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>It were with theſe and divers other conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the like Nature, that were back'd with that l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:135663:297"/> to prevail ſo with the Marchioneſs as that he might but ſee her. She immediately went about it, and was not long before ſhe return'd with leave for him to come to her, where he might ſtay ſo long as ſhe were by, to which he preſently conſenting, he went with her to the Marchioneſs's Chamber, he was no ſooner at the Door, but that he run, and caſting himſelf at her Feet, he ſaid: <hi>Madam, I am come to offer you an heart more buſied with an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ambition of ſerving you further yet,</hi> than poſſeſt with the thoughts of receiving any recompence for his former Services: <hi>Yet, Madam, not ſo wholly inſenſible of the happineſs, which he might receive from you, if you would but allow him ſome place in your eſteem, as not humbly to ſue for it. Sir,</hi> reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Marchioneſs, making ſome motion which expreſs'd her deſire that he ſhould riſe, <hi>I cannot be ſo inſenſible, of that generous aſſiſtance which I have receiv'd from you, as not to reſent it with all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude that my boſome can be capable of, and it is ſo lately that I have felt the advantage of it, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo ſoon forget it. I do acknowledge, Sir, before this Lady here,</hi> continued ſhe, <hi>that I am infinitely oblig'd to you for what you have lately done in my concerns, for proof whereof, I do confeſs that I owe you all that my abilities in the preſent condition I am, and that my honour can permit me to give you; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, I being of a Diſpoſition, as will not permit me to remain long in peace with my ſelf while that virtue lies unrewarded: I gladly receiv'd, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd your requeſt of ſeeing me, that I might have the opportunity of giving you ſome ſmall Tokens of my gratitude, till my good Fortune does enable me to further reach the merits of your ſingular Services to me; be pleas'd therefore to accept of all that little
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:135663:298"/> which I have in my own diſpoſing at preſent, till Time and Fortune do further enable me to ſuit my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more proportionable to your deſerts. Camille</hi> was going to anſwer, when ſhe thus went on, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of the middle of a Toylet that was upon a Table near her: Here, Sir, is all I have, it is ſmall, conſidering what I owe you, I doubt not but that a Perſon that has acted ſo generouſly as you have done, will be contented with the good will, where the Power cannot extend any further, with that ſhe lifted off the Toylet which ſhe held in her hand, and diſcover'd to <hi>Camille's</hi> Eyes, a parcel of Jewels of great value. <hi>Camille</hi> had no ſooner caſt his Eyes upon them, but turning his Face from them, with an air that did expreſs a contemning of ſuch trifles. You have a deſign to mock me, Madam, ſaid he, with an emotion which expreſs'd his diſlike, in pretending to gratify me, while you offer me this parcel of Jewels, and at the ſame time you reſerve to your ſelf that ineſtimable Gem, your heart, which might ſet me in poſſeſſion of thoſe Mines of Treaſures which diſcover their Luſtre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your Face, and—he was going on, when the Marchioneſs did thus interrupt him: Sir, you have very ſoon forgot the promiſes which you made to my Servant here, and doubtleſs that you were thinking of ſomething elſe while you made them; yet I am happy in that you have obſerv'd ſo much of them as has invited you to put me into the hands of ſo worthy a Lady as this is, and in a place where I need not fear any thing beyond words; yet give me leave to tell you that they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize me much; but however, Sir, I am extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorry, that I cannot gratifie you out of my own ſtore, and that you covet that which I was forc'd
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:135663:298"/> long ago to part with to another, tho' I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs abſolutely againſt my will; but however now it is no more mine, and though this Boſome, pointing at her Breaſt, is ſtill the Caskanet, wherein it is kept; there is ſuch a ſtrong Guard ſet upon it by Virtue, as can never be forc'd but with the loſs of my Life, till the right owner of it, though he is never ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, loſes his property in it by death. If that were all, Madam, ſaid <hi>Camille,</hi> his Life were not ſo conſiderable, that he ſhould be loath to loſe it, or any one fear the taking of it away, which would be but like removing a Stone out of the way that would lead to the poſſeſſion of that precious Jewel: This did <hi>Camille</hi> ſay in a tone that expreſs'd much diſorder in his mind, of which the Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs taking notice: That were the way, ſaid ſhe, to caſt ſo dark a Cloud over it, and the raſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker of ſo foul a deed, as would eternally dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken its luſtre, and hide for ever from my Eyes that Perſon, that ſhould ſo unworthily attempt it, or ſhould they offer the leaſt violence to deprive me of it, I ſhould look upon them, as on the worſt of men; and I would certainly ſacrifice my Life for its preſervation. This did the Marchioneſs ſpeak with ſo much reſolution and boldneſs, that <hi>Camille</hi> was at a ſtand, not knowing what he ſhould ſay. Which gave the Marchioneſs leiſure to continue in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. But I can diſtinguiſh between what is ſpoken in raillery, and by way of common diſcourſe, from that which might proceed from the Heart, and I have better thoughts of my deliverer, neither can it enter in my imagination, that a Perſon that has ſo frankly ſerv'd me, ſhould harbour in his Breaſt ſuch mean and unworthy deſigns, while he contemns thoſe things which might have taken with any mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and low Spirited Perſons. But I am confident,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:135663:299"/> continued ſhe, that you are above thoſe trifles, and that like all other brave Souls, yours expects its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from that virtue, which ſet it on thoſe brave actions, which cannot be recompenc'd, but by that ſame virtue, which firſt did move it to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. Here <hi>Camille</hi> being overcome by the Marchioneſs's generous expreſſions, and looking upon thoſe deſigns with which he had approach'd her, as groſs and foul Earthy exhalations, which if not diſperſed from his mind, by thoſe refulgent Rayes, which the brightneſs of the Marchioneſs's brave example did caſt upon him, would hinder him from appearing with the like luſtre, and from mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſame Sphere of Virtue that ſhe did; he therefore, wholly changing his mind, and firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, as ſcorning to be out-done by a Woman, did immediately caſt from himſelf all laſcivious deſires, and low thoughts, to give a full and entire poſſeſſion of his Soul to Virtue, which made him anſwer the Marchioneſs in this manner.</p>
                  <p>That Virtue, Madam, which ſhines with ſo much luſtre through all your actions, were more than ſufficient, were I any other ways inclin'd, to work perfect reformation in me. It appears ſo great, ſo glorious, and ſo amiable in you, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that can be ſaid to ſurpaſs all thoſe other bleſſings of body and mind, that the Heavens have ſhowr d upon you with a prodigal hand, which moves an emulation in all generous Spirits; hence-forward, Madam, continued he, I bid adieu to all the little Sallies and Gayeties of inordinate Youth, to wait with patience at your Feet, for what the Heavens will be pleas'd to ſet apart for me; only this, Madam, I humbly crave of you, that if ever there be hopes, I may ſtand the faireſt in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:135663:299"/> your affections; he will out-live your patience, Sir, reply'd the Marchioneſs; then turning her Head aſide to hide ſome bluſhes, which what ſhe was going to ſay did ſpread over her Face: at leaſt I fear ſo, continued ſhe, with a ſigh, after a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pauſe: Oh! Madam, what a Cordial have you adminiſtred to my fainting heart? reply'd
<hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi> ſay but once more, Madam, that you have that eſteem for me, as to allow of your Hearts good Wiſhes in my behalf, and I proteſt by all that is ſacred, never to endeavour my happineſs by any ſiniſter means; I ſhall with an exemplary patience wait for what my Stars and your fair ſelf have decreed for me, and employ all that time that ſhall run betwixt this moment and then, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring your Beauties, in ſetting forth your praiſes, and in obeying your Commands, with all the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, zeal, and diligence, that a Heart ſo poſſeſt with the admiration of your Virtues, as mine is, can be capable of. And I muſt tell you, reply'd the Marchioneſs, that ſo long as you bring that temper along with you, you ſhall be welcome to my heart, in which you may claim as a great ſhare, as Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Honour can allow you. This Crowns that Victory, Madam, anſwer'd <hi>Camille,</hi> which I have lately obtain'd over my paſſions, and that honour which I receive of being the firſt in your eſteem, is ſo far beyond all that I ſhall ever merit, that I can deſire no more than the permiſſion to ſeal the proteſtation which I here make to be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally yours, (with that the Marchioneſs gave him her Hand to kiſs) upon this white Author of my happineſs, continued he, till I have leave to taſte of that Nectar which flows on your Lips. That you once took, ſaid the Marchioneſs, when I was
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:135663:300"/> not in a condition to forbid it, which I have you know forgiven you, and I will not refuſe ſo inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant a thing however you eſteem it, when you ſue ſo modeſtly for it, but ſtop there, and let the bounds of your deſires be limited within this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, till it ſhall pleaſe the Heavens to enlarge them; After this <hi>Camille</hi> kiſs'd her Lip, and was going to return her thanks with an aſſurance of his moderation, when Father <hi>Andrew</hi> enter'd the Chamber as brisk as could be, ſaying, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, give me my News-gift before I tell you the beſt news that you have heard ſince your delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. That I will good Father, reply'd the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs, for I own my ſelf already much indebted to you; with that ſhe took up a fair Diamond-Ring which lay upon the Table, and taking out of her Pocket a Purſe of Gold, Sir, ſaid ſhe in a low voice to <hi>Camille,</hi> giving him the Ring, accept of this pledge of my Friendſhip, and wear it for my ſake; then turning to Father
<hi>Andrew;</hi> and you good Father, continued ſhe, receive this ſmall reward of your Services, until I am in a better capacity to acknowledge them: ſaying this, ſhe gave him the purſe of Gold. The good Father having receiv'd the golden bleſſing with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bow, he thus began his Story.</p>
                  <p>I am but juſt now return'd from the City, where after divers inquiries, I have learned that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs your Huband, Madam, was return'd to his Lodgings before day, that he had been taken ſo violently ill of a Feaver, that all the Phyſicians of the Town that are about him had given him for dead; notwithſtanding the frequent repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of bleeding, and all the other means that their Art can uſe upon him; his Feaver increaſing ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:135663:300"/> that he ſays himſelf that he is a dead Man: This made me go to a Religious Father of my acquaintance here, where having fitted my ſelf with a Religious Habit, I deſired him to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany me to the Marqueſs, where I prayed him to mix amongſt his comforts ſome gentle touches of his hard uſage of you, with ſome admonition to make you amends at his Death. But when we came there, I ſtanding a little aſide, leſt my preſence ſhould diſtract his thoughts, I found him already diſpos'd as I would have him, he was ſaying to his Kinſman the Juſtice that is with him, that he was very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the wrongs which he had done his Wife, that he wiſh'd that he could but once again ſee her before he died, to ask her pardon for it; that for proof that this reconciliation to his Wife was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, he declar'd, after ſome few Legacies and ſome guifts to the Church to pray for his ſoul, he would leave his dear Wife ſole Heir of his Eſtate. This news made the Marchioneſs to go immediatly to her Husband, who did no ſooner perceive her, but he took her by the hand, and did a Thouſand times ask her pardon for his ill treating of her, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had ratified the Will which he had made, ſince Father <hi>Andrew</hi>'s abſence, and which was in his Kinſmans hands, having call'd for it, and given it to her in the preſence of all, he preſently after gave up the Ghoſt. The Marchioneſs after this, leaving directions with her Husbands Kinſman concerning what ſhe would have done, leaving to his management all the concerns in that City; as alſo the care of her Husband's Tranſportation and Burial in his own Country, according to his deſires, amongſt his Anceſtors; ſhe return d to <hi>Alphonſo</hi>'s
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:135663:301"/> Houſe, where being fatigated and late in the Night, ſhe went to Bed.</p>
                  <p>The next morning after that ſhe was up and ready to receive a viſit, <hi>Camille</hi> came to her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his ſuit, ſummoning her of her promiſes; to which ſhe made anſwer, that ſhe would do him Juſtice; after which <hi>Don Alphonſo,</hi> his Lady, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Andrew,</hi> and <hi>Zora,</hi> being preſent, ſhe declar'd before them all, that ſhe receiv'd Signior <hi>Camille</hi> for her Husband, ſhe gave him her hand in aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it, and further ſaid, that ſo ſoon as ſhe had paid thoſe formalities which were due to the dead, ſhe would confirm it by marriage. <hi>Camille</hi> full of Joy did return her all the thanks imaginable; the whole company did applaud her choice, and wiſh'd them both all Joy and Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>After that all the ceremonies of the Funeral were over, and that the Marchioneſs had ſent her late Husband's Kinſman to take poſſeſſion in her name of what he had left her, ſhe began, through <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mille</hi>'s inceſſant importunities, to think on Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: In ſhort, within the compaſs of ſome Months they were Married, to both their contents, after which they having return'd infinite thanks to <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi> and his Lady, and given them ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, as alſo to the Juſtice who had been their Friend: they took leave of all, and return'd into <hi>Italy,</hi> taking along with them, the good Father <hi>Andrew,</hi> and
<hi>Zora,</hi> where they were both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for during their lives very plentifully; and
<hi>Camille</hi> having made his peace with the Church, he enjoy'd his Marchioneſs with great pleaſure and content.</p>
